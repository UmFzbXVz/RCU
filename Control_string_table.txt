AMB_AH_CONV_01_AHTI_2288: [0.04-5.35]It's time for a coffee break soon.[5.35-9.02]Aah, kaffea.

AMB_AH_CONV_04_AHTI_2297: [0.17-3.55]The Containment Sector has blown to pussy's splinters.[4.89-8.57]The work won't end even if you keep doing it.
AMB_AH_CONV_05_AHTI_2298: [0.13-0.91]Yep yep.[1.39-8.32]The janitor is the one who makes everything running and under control.
AMB_AH_CONV_05_AHTI_2299: The first thing I'm gonna do when I get to my vacation is to get drunk. 
AMB_AH_CONV_05_AHTI_2300: When the time comes, I'm gonna go on my vacation, like dad went into mom. 
AMB_AH_CONV_05_AHTI_3434: [0.15-3.48]They don't appreciate good music.[4.90-9.22]And that's the reason they can go as far as pepper grows.

AMB_AH_CONV_05_AHTI_3436: [0.30-2.30]Sausages on eyes.[3.76-8.93]A drop won't kill you and you can't drown in a bucket.
AMB_ATLAS_02_ATLAS_RANGER_MEDIC_3524: [0.00-0.53]You're fine.[0.82-1.82]We'll push through this.
AMB_ATLAS_02_ATLAS_WOUNDED_RANGER_3523: I'm not doing so hot.
AMB_ATLAS_02_ATLAS_WOUNDED_RANGER_3525: The Hiss're the ones doing the pushing, doc.
AMB_ATLAS_03_ATLAS_RANGER_MEDIC_3526: [0.04-0.86]Director Faden.[1.38-2.67]Boy are we glad to see you.
AMB_ATLAS_03_ATLAS_RANGER_MEDIC_3527: [0.04-2.23]Just stay calm and keep those HRAs on.[2.62-3.77]We'll get you out soon.
AMB_ATLAS_03_ATLAS_RANGER_MEDIC_3528: Put more pressure on that wound.
AMB_ATLAS_03_ATLAS_RANGER_MEDIC_3529: Christ, we’re running low on everything!
AMB_ATLAS_03_ATLAS_RANGER_MEDIC_3530: [0.00-1.78]That shit the Hiss are spouting...[2.62-5.95]I've seen parapsychosis, but what the hell is a "worm through time"?

AMB_ATLAS_03_ATLAS_WOUNDED_RANGER_3535: (Groans in pain)
AMB_EP_CONV_01_POPE_2217: [0.32-2.61]These readings are erratic, even for the Oldest House.[3.08-6.65]The Hiss are tampering with it somehow, agitating it.[7.30-9.28]Matching frequencies, maybe...
AMB_EP_CONV_02_POPE_2218: [0.15-3.51]Physical alterations in Hiss corrupted organisms vary so wildly.[3.86-5.22]What’s the connection?
AMB_EP_CONV_03_POPE_2219: [0.15-5.66]The resonance emitted from the HRAs is purely antithetical to every variant of the Hiss signal I can arrange.[6.29-7.97]But how did Darling create it?
AMB_EP_CONV_04_POPE_2220: [0.49-5.37]If the Slide Projector requires a slide to open dimensional doorways then which is the Object of Power?[5.40-7.49]The slides or the projector?[8.16-10.41]Or is the distinction itself a fallacy?
AMB_EP_CONV_05_HUB_RESEARCHER_3_2222: [0.18-3.03]I found a couple relevant files in Dr. Darling’s office.[3.20-7.17]I’d have to dig through the Archives for the rest, but I’m not going through the Panopticon.[7.66-9.76]Not with the Altered Items loose.
AMB_EP_CONV_05_POPE_2221: Where are the files on parasitic entities I asked for?
AMB_EP_CONV_05_POPE_2223: Then go see if any Ranger squads are available for a file retrieval mission.
AMB_EP_CONV_06_HUB_RESEARCHER_3_2225: [0.14-1.11]It’s possible.[1.29-4.91]I remember a report about a similar incident from ‘84.[5.08-8.42]The Bureau lost contact with a whole department during a House Shift.[8.61-14.01]The department head was found in the Motel two years later, his arm stuck in the vending machine.
AMB_EP_CONV_06_POPE_2224: [0.43-2.91]There haven’t been any Hiss sightings in the Oceanview Motel.[3.28-5.11]Could survivors be hiding inside?
AMB_EP_CONV_06_POPE_2226: Make a note to send in a search party when possible.
AMB_EP_CONV_07_HUB_RESEARCHER_3_2228: [0.12-1.14]Sorry, ma’am.[1.17-1.96]I took them.[2.26-7.04]Darling asked for any visual materials to be stowed for future instructional videos.[7.10-10.74]He asked for anything that looks particularly good in a backdrop.
AMB_EP_CONV_07_POPE_2227: Who moved my waveform of the Hiss recording? 
AMB_EP_CONV_07_POPE_2229: [0.15-4.45]Inform all research staff that any instructional videos are postponed indefinitely.[4.86-6.31]And don’t ever touch my work again.
AMB_EP_FAREWELLS_POPE_2206: Be careful out there.
AMB_EP_FAREWELLS_POPE_2207: See you soon.
AMB_EP_FAREWELLS_POPE_2208: Bye for now.

AMB_FL_CONV_01_LANGSTON_3500: [0.44-2.09]Numerous cell breaches on every level![3.07-5.11]These Hiss things are a bad influence on my collection.
AMB_FL_CONV_02_LANGSTON_3501: I better not get blamed for this mess in the next performance review.
AMB_FL_CONV_02_LANGSTON_3502: I have a cat to feed.
AMB_FL_CONV_03_LANGSTON_3503: [0.25-2.95]I told Salvador it was dangerous, but no.[3.00-4.41]Why listen to Langston?[5.48-7.46]I’m just the Panopticon Supervisor.
AMB_FL_CONV_04_LANGSTON_3504: [0.30-2.11]So many cell breaches.[2.11-4.77]I guess life’s a “breach”, huh?

AMB_FL_M06_GENERICS_LANGSTON_3519: [0.16-2.96]Cell breaches popping up all over the place.[4.54-5.92]What’s going on with the Items?
AMB_HM_CONV_01_LUCK_RANGER_1_2078: [0.07-1.55]Squad C hasn’t made it back.[1.76-4.80]They’re still out there, which means we should assume they’re KIA, ma’am.[5.19-9.30]Only exit is back through Parakinesiology, but then there’s no way we’re making it to the lab.[9.77-12.10]Only option is to hold here and wait for an opening.[12.34-14.23]Then we put everything we got into one final push.
AMB_HM_CONV_01_LUCK_RANGER_1_2080: [0.03-2.75]Marshall said we need more HRAs.[3.14-9.93]If you want to go sit in a corner and suck your fucking thumb, don’t let me stop you, but no one will be calling you a Ranger afterwards.

AMB_HM_CONV_02_MARSHALL_2082: Has anyone heard from Salvador?
AMB_HM_CONV_02_MARSHALL_2084: I think I know the reason.

AMB_HM_CONV_04_MARSHALL_2088: [0.17-1.17]Situation report.[1.17-1.84]All sectors.
AMB_HM_CONV_04_MARSHALL_2090: Let’s hope.
AMB_HM_FAREWELLS_MARSHALL_2066: Stay safe.
AMB_HM_FAREWELLS_MARSHALL_2067: Keep an eye on yourself, Director.
AMB_HM_FAREWELLS_MARSHALL_2068: We’re relying on you, Director.
AMB_HM_FAREWELLS_MARSHALL_2069: Be careful out there. 
AMB_HM_FAREWELLS_MARSHALL_2070: Goodbye, Faden.
AMB_HM_FAREWELLS_MARSHALL_2071: Remember, the Hiss isn’t the only danger out there.
AMB_HM_FAREWELLS_MARSHALL_2072: Keep your wits about you.
AMB_HM_FAREWELLS_MARSHALL_2073: The Bureau will survive this.
AMB_HM_FAREWELLS_MARSHALL_2074: Good luck, Director.
AMB_HM_FAREWELLS_MARSHALL_2075: Remember your duties, Director Faden.
AMB_HM_GREETINGS_MARSHALL_2056: Faden.
AMB_HM_GREETINGS_MARSHALL_2057: Director.
AMB_HM_GREETINGS_MARSHALL_2058: Good to see you, Faden.
AMB_HM_GREETINGS_MARSHALL_2059: Welcome back, Faden.
AMB_HM_GREETINGS_MARSHALL_2060: Hello, Faden.
AMB_HM_GREETINGS_MARSHALL_2061: Hello, Director.
AMB_HM_GREETINGS_MARSHALL_2062: Good to see you, Director.
AMB_HM_GREETINGS_MARSHALL_2063: Well, if it isn’t the Director.
AMB_HM_GREETINGS_MARSHALL_2064: Welcome back, Director.
AMB_HM_GREETINGS_MARSHALL_2065: Do you need something, Director?
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_01_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3539: If Darling’s notes are correct, even a single prism should be able to produce enough HRAs for everyone.
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_01_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3541: [0.04-3.37]Before he began making videos, I did all of Darling’s transcription.[3.63-6.02]I was thrilled when the Comms Department gave him a media team.
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_01_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3540: [0.08-2.24]How can you make heads or tails of his notes?[2.62-5.07]It’s all random numbers and symbols to me...[5.63-6.65]and song lyrics?
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_02_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3543: [0.04-2.12]They strike me as instinctual.[2.39-4.96]Less conscious, more like a...[4.99-6.35]collective impulse.[6.93-8.30]I would certainly like to interview one.
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_02_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3545: Dissection, then.
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_02_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3542: What do you make of these Hiss?
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_02_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3544: I doubt they’ll have much in the way of answers.
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_03_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3547: Maybe he's trying to test our codebreaking skills.
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_03_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3546: [0.00-2.75]Is Dr. Darling's penmanship intentionally this bad?
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_04_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3548: Do you have a spare diamond?
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_04_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3550: I want to see where Black Rock Prisms lie on the Moh’s scale of hardness.
AMB_HRA_LAB_01_CONV_04_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3549: [0.00-0.39]What?[0.85-1.45]No.[1.83-2.53]Why?
AMB_HRA_LAB_02_CONV_01_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3551: Where did you attend school?
AMB_HRA_LAB_02_CONV_01_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3553: [0.00-0.80]Also M.[0.80-0.92]I.[0.92-1.18]T.
AMB_HRA_LAB_02_CONV_01_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3552: [0.03-0.19]M.[0.19-0.29]I.[0.29-0.67]T.[1.05-1.71]How about you?
AMB_HRA_LAB_02_CONV_02_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3555: So long as the Hiss are out there, we’ll be making more.
AMB_HRA_LAB_02_CONV_02_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3554: [0.03-1.98]Eons later, here we are.[2.61-4.35]Haven’t we made enough HRAs?
AMB_HRA_LAB_02_CONV_02_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3556: Then we ought to let them in here.
AMB_HRA_LAB_02_CONV_02_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3557: I’m kidding, of course.
AMB_HRA_LAB_GEN_01_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3558: [0.03-0.60]Ms. Faden.
AMB_HRA_LAB_GEN_01_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3559: [0.03-1.73]I try to avoid looking at the time.[2.30-4.79]A ticking clock discourages productivity.
AMB_HRA_LAB_GEN_01_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3563: [0.03-3.96]Black Rock Prisms vibrate in harmony with some outside force.[4.29-8.73]It looks like Darling was using the Prisms to carve that harmony into the HRAs.
AMB_HRA_LAB_GEN_02_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3560: It is good to see someone with fewer grey hairs in a position of leadership.
AMB_HRA_LAB_GEN_02_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3564: Director.
AMB_HRA_LAB_GEN_02_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3565: I’m not sure I’ve ever been away from my research station for this long.
AMB_HRA_LAB_GEN_03_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3561: [0.08-3.64]I did my thesis on the importance of punchcards in the evolution of computing.[4.44-6.66]I suppose that makes me the right person for this job.[7.63-10.00]I am also frustrated this is the case.
AMB_HRA_LAB_GEN_03_HRA_RESEARCHER_1_3567: [0.00-2.41]The mold below Research has such a pleasant smell...[2.74-4.03]almost like fresh bread.
AMB_HRA_LAB_GEN_03_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3562: "And she walked in looking like dynamite..."
AMB_HRA_LAB_GEN_03_HRA_RESEARCHER_2_3566: What I wouldn’t give for some better light.
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3598: [0.06-2.48]Only the people with HRAs survived.[3.50-4.11]Interesting.
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3599: [0.00-2.59]Pope waltzes into the Boardroom and says it’s her office.[2.91-4.31]Who the hell does she think she is?
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3600: [0.00-2.10]Why are we trusting Pope to lead our research?[2.15-3.72]She’s not even a department chief.
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3601: If this is all because some Altered Item got loose, I’m gonna kill Langston.
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3602: How are we supposed to gather data if we can’t get close to those things?
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3603: [0.00-1.64]This is only happening in Executive, right?[2.16-3.64]The other sectors might be fine.[4.19-4.62]Right?
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3604: This isn’t just some new Threshold effect, is it?
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3605: If they occupy a host’s mind and utilize their skills, then the Bureau’s number of combat staff just became our biggest liability.
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3606: [0.15-3.72]I hope the survivors in Research are closer to finding a solution for this.[4.91-8.04]But what if we’re the only ones left...?
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3590: I’m surprised Tommasi isn’t here giving some big speech about overcoming adversity.
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3594: [0.00-1.43]Where are the security teams?[2.04-3.80]They’re supposed to handle these sort of things!
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3595: [0.03-0.86]God, I’m hungry.[0.86-4.84]I wonder if I could reach the cafeteria without running into any of those things.[5.33-7.09]I think they were serving pancakes.
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3596: [0.03-1.91]I wish I’d never even heard of this place.[2.54-4.59]I should have stayed with the FBI.
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3597: Moving buildings, other dimensions, flying TVs, and now these things?
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3587: [0.11-1.75]I heard you got us out of the safe room.[2.09-2.63]Thanks.
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3588: Did these things get into the other sectors?
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3589: [0.04-3.44]Booker, Susan, Delgado...[4.31-5.27]They’re all dead.
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3591: God, I hope Donna made it to a safe room in time...
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3592: What happened to everyone who didn’t make it to a safe room?
AMB_HUB_01_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3593: [0.03-0.99]I can’t take this.[1.39-2.82]I can’t take this.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3582: [0.03-0.56]With what?[0.93-4.44]We can’t get any equipment from the Research Sector until the internal lockdown is lifted.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3584: Pope has asked us to document the Hiss “incantation”, as she calls it.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3586: [0.03-0.71]In person.[0.94-2.01]With a pencil and paper.[2.39-3.77]I think she’s trying to get us killed.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3581: Pope wants us to get a field lab set up as soon as possible.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3583: [0.00-1.84]Then see what you can find around here.[2.28-5.53]Computers, documents, any measuring devices you can find.[5.94-8.81]Helping Pope is a surefire way to get on Darling’s good side.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3585: You mean like, in person?
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_1_3569: [0.03-1.61]That red light got him, but...[2.48-4.58]honestly, I don’t know what happened.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_1_3571: [0.07-0.77]Where’s Marshall?[1.11-1.75]Or Trench?[2.42-3.99]How come no one’s taking charge here?
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_1_3573: [0.07-1.07]New Director?[1.54-2.47]Who the fuck is it?[2.77-3.98]Did they neutralize Trench?
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_1_3575: [0.03-4.49]The Executive Sector is supposed to have a designated security team here for our protection.[4.94-5.89]Where the hell are they?
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_1_3577: I can’t believe they didn’t think of these things when they installed the lockdown system.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_1_3578: [0.10-1.66]Thank god we’re out of that safe room.[2.36-3.56]I was suffocating in there.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_1_3580: [0.03-1.28]Hey, I know what I felt![1.60-2.55]They’re too small![2.95-5.44]Executive staff should get bigger safe rooms!
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_2_3568: [0.04-1.65]I can’t get over what happened to Booker...[1.65-2.45]to Smith...[2.49-3.10]the others.[3.42-5.18]Why did they start acting like that?
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_2_3570: [0.03-1.11]I keep thinking about...[1.47-3.07]the pulsing under his skin.[3.07-4.09]And those words.[4.42-5.65]They’re stuck in my head.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_2_3572: [0.00-1.05]You didn't hear?[1.99-3.04]Trench is dead.[4.13-6.72]There’s a new Director, apparently.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_2_3574: Keep your voice down. 
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_2_3576: [0.03-4.14]If the internal lockdown is in effect, then they can’t use the elevator to reach us.[4.64-5.61]We’re on our own.
AMB_HUB_01_HUB_WORKER_2_3579: [0.05-2.15]Oxygen’s pumped in into the rooms.[2.25-4.44]There was never any risk of suffocating.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3638: [0.04-0.51]Gah![0.66-1.94]There’s no logic to this.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3639: I don’t see the connection, but it’s clearly interdependent.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3640: [0.05-2.60]I hope the grease monkeys in Maintenance can keep the lights on.[3.15-4.71]A blackout would be the end of us.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3641: [0.08-2.61]All I need to do is beat Pope to the solution.[3.79-5.34]If a solution is even possible.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3642: [0.10-1.28]We’re in the dark here.[1.82-3.35]Where’s Darling when we need him?
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3643: The HRA reacts to the Hiss resonance, negating it...
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3644: [0.16-4.83]But to codify the Hiss genetic sequence using reel-to-reel technology would take...[6.25-7.15]Christ.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3645: [0.14-1.41]Come on.[1.64-3.36]You’re smarter than this.[3.73-5.37]People are counting on you.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3646: [0.00-0.67]Focus.[1.20-3.18]Help your friends by not worrying.[3.42-5.11]Worrying only wastes time.[5.49-7.00]Focus on the work.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3627: [0.11-2.74]Trench is dead and Tommasi turned Hiss...[3.73-5.21]We’re running out of management.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3628: [0.04-1.30]Marshall should be here.[1.77-3.79]If anyone could fight the Hiss off, it’d be her.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3629: [0.16-2.81]Can’t believe I’m missing the college game tonight.[3.56-5.31]Rexes against the Sabres.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3630: [0.03-4.79]Terrible things happen at the Bureau, yeah, but it’s always in Containment or Research.[5.15-6.19]Not Executive.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3631: [0.09-1.67]Fucking manual labor.[2.22-4.57]I didn’t take a government job to use my hands.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3632: [0.06-1.49]So Tommasi turned Hiss.[2.34-4.29]Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3633: [0.03-1.60]I should’ve called my folks back.[2.25-4.12]Why do I never call them back?
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3634: [0.10-0.73]Almost done.[1.78-2.91]I hope I got this right.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3635: [0.05-0.86]Someone will come.[1.02-2.43]Someone’ll know what to do.
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3636: [0.03-1.39]That rumbling sounded pretty bad.[2.10-3.45]Was that the Power Plant?
AMB_HUB_02_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3637: We won’t hold this spot for long without some Rangers.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3614: [0.12-1.79]They’re saying Trench was shot dead.[2.27-3.86]The situation’s getting worse.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3616: [0.00-0.79]Don’t be stupid.[1.02-4.29]What would the Bureau’s golden child have to gain from killing the boss?
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3618: [0.03-1.89]The Power Plant is largely confidential.[2.02-5.65]No use guessing the Hiss’s motives if we don’t even know what kind of energy it uses.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3622: [0.00-0.66]Bullshit![0.97-3.39]We’ve never recorded any distance over five.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3625: [0.00-0.49]Here?[1.02-2.70]But we don’t have the proper facilities.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3615: [0.10-2.90]I saw Trench and Darling arguing a couple weeks ago.[3.11-4.47]Trench was furious.[4.83-5.90]You don’t think Darling.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3617: [0.07-2.08]I heard the Hiss attacked the Power Plant.[2.39-3.96]Brings up a lot of new questions.[4.37-5.45]Are they communicating?[5.65-6.48]Coordinating?[6.84-8.55]What about the Plant attracted them?
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3619: [0.07-1.01]What do you mean?[1.45-3.07]It has to be a fusion reactor.[3.47-5.98]There’s no other way to create that kind of energy output.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3620: Right?
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3621: They say the new Director can Launch objects up to 20 feet.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3623: Obviously you never read the P6 data.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3624: A lot of these questions could be answered by obtaining a live specimen.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3626: [0.03-3.69]Maybe we can bring in an observation unit from the Containment Sector.[4.37-5.81]I’ll put in a request with Pope.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_WORKER_1_3608: [0.14-2.29]I say we make a break for the exit.[2.57-4.69]If we stay here, we’re just gonna end up turning Hiss.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_WORKER_1_3610: [0.09-1.93]So we’re stuck here, with the monsters.[2.37-3.08]Left to die.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_WORKER_1_3611: [0.03-1.17]I can’t believe we’re doing this.[1.65-3.65]I’m a senior executive.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_WORKER_1_3613: [0.06-1.74]But I don’t even know what I’m doing![2.18-4.78]She should find some Maintenance grunt to do this.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_WORKER_2_3609: [0.00-2.90]The building lockdown is in effect to keep the Hiss quarantined.[3.24-5.58]We couldn’t open the doors even if we wanted to.
AMB_HUB_02_HUB_WORKER_2_3612: [0.07-2.51]Apparently the Hiss are infiltrating Control Points.[2.68-4.76]Pope says setting these things up may help.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3665: [1.75-3.78]Looking good on hardware.[4.45-5.75]Grenades?[6.29-8.83]Hmm, running low.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3666: [0.06-1.33]We’re going through ammo like...[2.19-3.99]something that goes through things fast.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3667: [0.05-0.58]Wait...[1.14-2.98]somebody took the RPG.[3.28-5.69]Aw, Marshall’s gonna kill me.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3668: [1.42-4.08]Another box of ammo unaccounted for.[4.49-6.34]Nobody respects the clipboard.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3669: Once the new HRAs start rolling in, I’ll need to make a tracking sheet for them too.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_RANGER_1_3676: [0.04-1.16]We’re wasting time.[1.69-4.83]Hasn’t Marshall ever heard the best defense is a good offense?
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_RANGER_1_3677: [0.09-1.47]We gotta get back in the field![1.74-3.86]Who knows how many Rangers are waiting for back-up.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3670: [0.03-1.18]I was moving up, damn it.[1.80-3.96]In another year, department chief was mine.[4.48-5.35]Then this happens.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3671: [0.03-3.06]We don’t have the facilities here to analyze something as complex as the Hiss.[3.52-4.60]Pope’s delusional.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3672: Every time I think it makes it sense, the pattern shifts.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3673: [0.00-1.52]We have to figure this out.[1.81-3.34]No one else is going to do it.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3674: [0.10-2.75]All these references to “Hedron”...[4.47-5.81]there’s something we’re missing.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3675: I wonder if other species would verbalize the Hiss resonance like human hosts do.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3679: [0.03-2.93]Marshall will get the Rangers to clean this mess up.[3.37-4.57]We’ll be out of here in no time.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3680: [0.04-3.01]I wonder if that weird janitor had a hand in this.[3.76-5.26]I never trusted that freak.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3681: That new Director better not think about hitting my department with a reorg.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3678: [0.03-0.74]Marshall’s back.[1.56-3.33]Things will start to get back to normal.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3682: [0.03-2.45]Darling always seems to have these things under control.[2.78-4.57]We could really use him right now.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3683: [0.03-2.81]Sounds like the new Director is handling things as well as she can.[3.72-5.04]Hell of a first day.
AMB_HUB_03_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3684: [0.16-1.52]I feel useless.[1.52-4.44]What can someone from admin do against this kind of thing?
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_1_3647: I can’t believe these suits lasted as long as they have.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_1_3649: [0.03-0.52]Bullshit.[1.41-4.09]I didn’t see them fighting to retake the HRA lab.[4.75-7.38]Rangers always get left to pick up management’s shit.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_1_3651: [0.00-1.63]It’s bad, but we can handle it.[2.33-5.91]Just like we handled that Altered Item making everyone drown themselves in the toilets.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_1_3653: [0.04-1.06]We should be out there![1.55-4.65]Those things are killing our buddies while we babysit the execs.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_1_3655: [0.12-0.80]Fuck that![0.98-2.96]The longer we sit here, the worse it’s gonna get.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_1_3656: Did you see me take down one of those flying motherfuckers?
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_1_3658: [0.00-1.51]You want me to go to Research?[2.13-3.31]Haul it here for you to see?[3.42-4.04]I’ll do it.[4.28-5.92]Doubt me again and I’ll fucking do it.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_2_3648: [0.10-0.85]Ease off.[1.26-2.26]We’re all in this together.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_2_3650: What’s your read on all this?
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_2_3652: Trench contained that thing, and he’s gone now.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_2_3654: [0.07-1.03]You heard Marshall.[1.28-2.84]We need to be smart about this.[3.09-5.15]They’ve got control of the entire Bureau.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RANGER_2_3657: Bullshit you did.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3659: [0.04-1.50]It’s ridiculous.[1.86-3.45]Pope’s grasping at straws.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3661: [0.00-0.87]Think about it.[1.20-3.50]The precision that would require is unthinkable.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3663: [0.04-2.41]She wants us to crack Darling’s personal logs?[2.85-4.48]He’ll crucify us if he finds out.[4.98-7.79]Who does she think she is, authorizing that kind of data breach?
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3660: [0.08-0.77]Why?[1.09-6.44]If Hiss is a frequency, then why couldn’t it vibrate molecules in order to alter human physiology?[6.63-8.30]It would explain the hair loss.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3662: Pope wants us to compile all of Darling’s data entries from the past month.
AMB_HUB_03_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3664: [0.04-1.78]She must think he’s hiding something.[1.88-2.90]And I agree.[3.41-7.25]The HRAs alone are proof Darling knew more than he let on.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3732: [0.03-2.74]Marshall didn’t give me any orders before she left...[2.89-4.87]Guess I’ll just keep managing inventory.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3733: Oof, lots of errors on this form...
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3734: And they said good stock management would never make a difference.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RANGER_1_3713: That Dylan guy creeps me the fuck out...
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RANGER_1_3714: I can’t believe we just let a Hiss stroll in here...
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RANGER_1_3715: [0.08-2.90]So, Pope’s got herself a pet Hiss.[3.62-5.94]This is why scientists shouldn’t make the calls.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RANGER_2_3716: [0.13-1.06]Arish...[1.62-3.26]Didn’t he used to be a Ranger?
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RANGER_2_3717: [0.09-1.45]The Hiss haven’t attacked lately.[2.11-3.70]Wonder why they’re so quiet.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RANGER_2_3718: [0.12-1.79]More people are finding their way here.[2.31-4.45]The Director must be securing other sectors.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3719: [0.00-2.17]Bringing a live Hiss here endangers us all.[2.79-4.52]Pope is clearly unfit for her role.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3720: [0.03-1.84]The lunatics are running the asylum.[2.44-3.56]We need Darling back.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3721: [0.03-1.74]The Director has taken a shine to Pope.[2.35-3.20]Explains a lot.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3722: Having access to a live Hiss subject will yield all sorts of useful data.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3723: [0.06-3.05]So many variations of the Hiss morphology...[3.68-8.48]I wonder if they’re distinct entities or stages of some rapid evolution process.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3724: As usual, more questions than answers...
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3725: If the Director’s brother is Hiss then whose side is she really on?
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3726: If that Pope woman was so talented, she would have found a solution to all this by now.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3727: [0.03-2.93]God I wish the Executive bathroom hadn’t shifted away.[3.70-4.91]I’d kill for a shower.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3728: I wonder how many agents we’ve lost.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3729: [0.03-1.07]We need to learn from this...[1.84-4.85]better emergency procedures, designated muster points.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3730: [0.03-3.38]We’ve lost employees before, but this is too much.[3.77-4.93]We need to do better.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3731: Trench left some big shoes to fill.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_3_3739: I should have taken a different desk.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_3_3740: [0.05-1.86]I can’t believe Trench is gone.[2.65-4.18]The man was an institution.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_3_3741: None of this would’ve happened if those morons in Research had more common sense.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_3_3742: [0.09-4.17]I bet when this is all over, we find out Darling was behind it.[4.52-6.33]That man was bound to snap.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_4_3735: [0.05-2.97]She’s just another part of it, the cabal, the unseen hands.[3.02-3.82]I know she is.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_4_3736: [0.10-1.41]This is all part of their plan.[1.79-5.62]They’re finally moving to exterminate us, to suppress the truth.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_4_3737: [0.08-1.73]The Tennyson Report was right.[2.42-5.11]The Bureau is just another front for the shadow government.[5.77-7.90]Invaders from the City beyond the Quarry.
AMB_HUB_04_GEN_HUB_WORKER_4_3738: Is the Oldest House really on lockdown, or is that just what they want us to believe?
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RANGER_1_3686: [0.03-2.96]Marshall orders us to just sit on our asses and then leaves?[3.48-4.13]What’s the deal?
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RANGER_1_3688: [0.03-1.27]Then she should’ve taken us with her![1.47-3.13]I need some action, god damn it!
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RANGER_1_3689: What do you know about this Arish guy?
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RANGER_1_3691: [0.03-0.96]All right, but still.[1.37-3.48]A security guard leading Rangers?[4.04-6.50]I don’t know if I like taking orders from a mall cop.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RANGER_1_3692: [0.00-1.95]Did you see that Hiss they marched through here?[2.58-4.92]Why the fuck didn’t we put a bullet in that thing’s head?
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RANGER_1_3694: [0.05-1.63]That’s no one’s brother anymore.[1.96-3.80]He’s the enemy, plain and simple!
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RANGER_2_3687: [0.03-1.11]She must have her reasons.[1.43-3.04]She’s probably out doing some recon.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RANGER_2_3690: [0.03-2.22]A heard some Rangers saying he saved them in Maintenance.[2.52-5.64]They were attacked by a new kind of Hiss and Arish got them out.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RANGER_2_3693: [0.03-1.58]I heard it’s the Director’s brother.[2.14-3.52]Would you shoot your brother?
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3701: Lots of interesting data off that subject the Rangers brought in.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3703: [0.00-1.27]She doesn’t know what she’s talking about.[1.65-3.09]Hiss aren’t that self-aware.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3704: [0.00-2.89]Why haven’t we dissected that freak mutation we locked up?[3.13-5.50]We could learn so much from its physiology.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3706: [0.00-0.60]No, that’s...[0.98-1.37]fine.[2.35-5.68]I’m sure we can find a more constructive use of our time.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3702: [0.03-2.66]I heard that he voluntarily entered captivity.[3.37-4.77]That’s what Pope said anyway.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3705: [0.00-2.22]He’s a valuable resource alive.[2.59-4.41]And Pope forbade any physical harm.[5.03-7.65]Of course, if you disagree, you could always go tell her.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_1_3696: [0.12-0.64]Great.[1.15-2.84]Maybe I can get back to my office soon.[3.52-5.23]I miss having a door to close on people.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_1_3698: [0.07-3.38]Just when I thought things were stabilizing, Marshall abandons us![3.88-6.18]I’m sick of no one telling us what’s going on!
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_1_3700: [0.00-1.61]Well, I need to fucking know.[1.91-4.11]I’m an upper level executive, damn it!
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_2_3695: [0.03-2.49]Apparently, the Director restored HRA production.[2.81-5.44]They’re already getting other survivors out of safe rooms.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_2_3697: I think you’re going to have to endure the inconvenience a little longer.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_2_3699: Information’s always been on a need-to-know basis.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_3_3708: [0.05-0.65]Brother?[1.19-2.21]And she brought him here?[2.81-4.22]She’s gonna get us all killed!
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_3_3710: [0.04-2.41]They’re endangering us by bringing a Hiss in here.[2.93-5.33]If Trench was still around, he’d have stopped this.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_3_3712: [0.12-2.49]Zacahriah Trench was a national hero.[2.85-5.50]Keep your conspiracy nonsense to yourself.
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_4_3707: Did you hear that the Hiss prisoner they captured is the Director’s brother?
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_4_3709: [0.00-1.84]What if she’s working with the Hiss?[2.24-4.62]Isn’t it strange she showed up just when they did?
AMB_HUB_04_HUB_WORKER_4_3711: [0.00-0.54]Please.[0.88-6.12]Trench was part of the same shadowy group that are responsible for every disaster this country’s ever seen.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3790: Now that we’re getting back on our feet, I should really talk to Arish about ration quantities.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3791: [0.00-2.83]This would make a great Night Springs episode.[3.22-5.67]“Visitors from the Red Zone”.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3792: [0.00-2.93]We’re going to need an additional source of munitions.[3.20-4.37]And fast.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_GUARD_1_3793: [0.03-3.58]Should I tell Arish about the flying traffic light I saw earlier?[4.63-6.32]Nah, he looks busy.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RANGER_1_3779: [0.03-2.55]The Director really showed those Hiss bastards![3.17-4.86]Arish better put me on the clean-up crew.[5.23-6.95]I could use some target practice.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RANGER_1_3780: [0.03-2.12]I hear the Director took on an Astral Spike.[2.29-3.64]God, what a bad-ass.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RANGER_1_3781: [0.03-1.34]At least the Hiss bleed.[2.01-5.32]Usually the shit here is like, I dunno, an angry rocking chair.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RANGER_1_3782: Guard duty is so boring.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RANGER_2_3783: None of my squad’s turned up yet...
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RANGER_2_3785: [0.03-3.38]Trench is dead, along with Salvador and Tommasi.[3.66-5.43]Marshall’s missing, Darling is...[5.84-6.62]somewhere.[7.31-9.47]How are we gonna recover from this?
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3770: [0.00-0.71]Pope has a...[1.14-2.37]knack for this work.[2.90-3.56]I’ll give her that.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3771: [0.12-2.66]The ambient Hiss presence in the sector has reduced.[3.76-5.79]Likely due to the Director’s intervention.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3772: [0.06-2.55]I can’t believe what they were doing in Dimensional Research.[2.83-4.80]I thought that entire project was just a rumor!
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3773: [0.00-2.26]A big reorg of the departments must be coming.[3.16-4.64]I wish I’d worn my good tie.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3774: [0.09-2.98]“An Introduction to Weaponizing HRAs”.[3.90-7.35]Pope is ambitious, no denying that.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3775: Did Dylan survive the cleansing process because of his exposure to the Hedron resonance?
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3776: [0.03-3.17]I haven’t had a moment to think about the Mold since the Hiss appeared.[4.42-6.47]I wonder if Dr. Underhill is doing all right.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3777: [0.03-1.80]We need to get ahead of the Hiss.[2.38-5.74]Pope has some wonderful theories, but we need actionable data.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3778: [0.14-2.40]Pope will make a wonderful Head of Research.[3.01-5.89]She has a very intuitive understanding of the paranatural.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3786: [0.07-4.28]The Director closes the Hiss dimension and she expects a pat on the back?[4.58-6.33]We’re still in lockdown for Christ’s sake!
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_WORKER_1_3787: We’re never getting out of here, are we?
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3788: I wonder when the building lockdown will be lifted?
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_WORKER_2_3789: [0.00-1.20]The building goes on forever.[1.78-3.12]How deep did the Hiss get?
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_WORKER_3_3798: [0.03-1.79]It’s time we got back to work.[2.26-4.81]We’re the Federal Bureau of Control, god damn it!
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_WORKER_3_3799: [0.04-2.49]People rely on us to contain this sort of thing.[2.78-3.99]We can’t let them down.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_WORKER_3_3800: [0.05-2.64]I can’t believe Trench opened the door for the Hiss.[3.43-5.05]I trusted that man.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_WORKER_4_3794: [0.21-1.24]“Jesse Faden”.[1.70-3.62]That’s a made up name if I ever heard one.[4.36-5.91]She must be one of them.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_WORKER_4_3795: [0.10-6.70]So the Director, whose brother is Hiss, just happens to find the secret Hiss entrance and close it.[7.07-8.11]How convenient.
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_WORKER_4_3796: [0.05-1.46]The planet isn’t round.[1.49-2.42]Or flat![2.66-5.49]It’s obviously a non-euclidean rhombus!
AMB_HUB_05_GEN_HUB_WORKER_4_3797: [0.03-1.34]My report is almost ready.[1.57-3.41]It’ll blow the lid off this whole thing.[3.73-6.09]Finally, the Bureau really will be in control!
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RANGER_1_3744: [0.16-2.65]Finally someone had the balls to take the fight to them![3.25-6.41]It’s about time we had someone other than an old man at the helm.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RANGER_1_3747: [0.03-1.40]Marshall’s as tough as they come.[1.96-3.25]You don’t need to worry about her.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RANGER_2_3743: [0.08-1.85]You heard the Director stopped the Hiss, right?[2.18-3.76]Sounds like she can really handle things.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RANGER_2_3745: [0.03-1.18]Actually, I agree.[1.50-3.51]She’s beaten the Hiss over and over.[3.73-6.07]If we win this thing, it’ll be because of her.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RANGER_2_3746: [0.00-1.47]When do you think Marshall’s coming back?[2.22-4.55]It’s not like her to be absent during a crisis.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RANGER_2_3748: I hope you’re right.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3756: [0.00-1.17]Head of Research?[2.56-3.76]When was the review process?[3.76-5.38]Why weren’t we consulted?
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3758: [0.17-1.62]So Darling is really gone.[3.17-4.10]End of an era.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3760: [0.04-2.66]That sounds like a perfect way for a man of science to go.[3.24-5.77]Godspeed, you brave son of a bitch.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3762: [0.09-0.97]Abnormalities?[1.40-3.54]Does she think the Hiss is still inside him?
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3755: [0.00-1.62]Pope is now Head of Research.[2.01-2.66]It’s official.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3757: [0.00-1.04]Calm down.[1.23-2.68]It’s pretty clear she earned it.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3759: [0.05-1.11]That’s what they’re saying.[1.90-4.71]I heard something about him falling into a different dimension.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3761: Pope wants a full physical examination of Dylan Faden, specifically looking for any physiological abnormalities.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3763: [0.04-3.68]She wants to rule it out entirely before we move on with our analysis.[4.16-7.12]She’s determined to learn how he survived the cleansing process.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_1_3750: [0.00-0.44]What?[1.01-3.07]The Director’s just handing out promotions?
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_1_3753: [0.08-1.08]I suppose.[1.08-3.14]But the Hiss are still all over the Bureau.[3.29-4.42]When is she going to get them out?
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_2_3749: [0.03-2.00]I heard Pope was promoted.[2.58-3.84]Head of Research.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_2_3751: I guess you better get in there.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_2_3752: Director Faden did a fine job handling this, especially considering how new she is.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_2_3754: [0.11-1.31]I’m sure she’s working on it.[1.58-4.38]It wouldn’t kill you to admit she’s doing a good job.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_3_3764: [0.03-2.44]The Director shut it down, no problem![2.61-3.79]It’s a huge victory.[4.07-4.84]Huge!
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_3_3766: [0.03-1.19]What are you talking about?[1.56-5.11]I’ve told you a hundred times to stop with your conspiracy horse shit.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_3_3768: [0.04-2.85]Can’t you just process these staff files quietly?[3.08-4.67]I don’t want to hear this.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_4_3765: I heard she sacrificed her brother’s soul to seal the Hiss dimension.
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_4_3767: [0.00-2.15]There’s no way this happened by accident.[2.28-3.03]I’m telling you.[3.45-6.24]The Board arranged this to whittle down our numbers.[6.50-7.20]To prepare...
AMB_HUB_05_HUB_WORKER_4_3769: [0.00-4.72]You don’t want to hear how we’re just sheep being led to slaughter by our own ignorance?[5.15-5.60]Fine![5.80-6.37]FINE!
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3813: Is she the one Pope was telling us about?
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3814: [0.00-0.31]Hm.[1.01-1.82]I don’t recognize her.
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_1_3815: Who’s she?
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3816: Who’s that?
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3817: [0.00-1.51]That’s the woman Pope mentioned.[2.00-3.29]Faden, or something.
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_RESEARCHER_2_3818: [0.04-0.33]Huh.[1.20-2.36]Must be a new hire.
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_WORKER_1_3806: Uh, hello.
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_WORKER_1_3807: Is she new?
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_WORKER_1_3808: [0.00-0.71]Who’s she?[1.14-2.73]And why’s she breaking dress code?
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_WORKER_1_3809: Is that the new Director?
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_WORKER_2_3810: Is that the Service Weapon?
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_WORKER_2_3811: I’ve never seen her before.
AMB_HUB_GEN_01_HUB_WORKER_2_3812: She must be new.

AMB_PAN_01_CONV_01_PANOPTICON_GUARD_2_3437: Can we provide any assistance at this time, sir?
AMB_PAN_01_CONV_02_LANGSTON_3441: [0.36-2.43]Some of the security cameras aren’t working.[2.46-3.70]How do I get those fixed?
AMB_PAN_01_CONV_02_LANGSTON_3443: [0.13-0.74]Oh, yeah.[0.74-1.93]Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
AMB_PAN_01_CONV_02_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3442: Maintenance staff will repair any damaged systems once normal operations have resumed, sir.
AMB_PAN_01_CONV_03_LANGSTON_3444: You guys didn’t bring, like, checkers or anything, did you?
AMB_PAN_01_CONV_03_LANGSTON_3446: You could’ve just said no.
AMB_PAN_01_CONV_03_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3445: Any active duty security personnel found engaging in non-sanctioned leisure activities will be relieved of duty pending review, sir.
AMB_PAN_01_CONV_04_LANGSTON_3447: [0.45-1.49]Hey, listen to this.[1.91-6.71]“Containment failure in Panopticon Cell 69”.
AMB_PAN_01_CONV_04_LANGSTON_3448: [0.47-0.92]Get it?[1.86-2.68]69?
AMB_PAN_01_CONV_04_LANGSTON_3450: [0.40-1.59]But you just said it![1.78-2.85]Come on, you guys.[2.85-3.69]It’s funny!
AMB_PAN_01_CONV_04_PANOPTICON_GUARD_2_3449: I do not see what is humorous about an escaped paranatural entity originating from cell 69, sir.
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_01_LANGSTON_3457: [0.15-0.62]There![0.82-3.48]Lower level security systems are up and running again.[3.92-4.94]Told you I could do it.
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_01_LANGSTON_3459: [0.20-1.63]Are you guys robots?[2.24-2.84]Seriously.[2.84-4.38]Do we have robots here now?
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_01_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3458: We never expressed an opinion that implied doubt in your abilities, sir.
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_01_PANOPTICON_GUARD_2_3460: We are perfectly human, sir.
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_02_LANGSTON_3461: [0.64-2.41]I’m worried about Alfred.[3.36-4.52]Do either of you have cats?
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_02_LANGSTON_3464: Right.
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_02_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3463: I am more of a reptile person.
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_02_PANOPTICON_GUARD_2_3462: I possess two canines, sir.
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_03_LANGSTON_3465: [0.26-3.09]How the hell did an Astral Spike end up in the Archives?[3.49-5.56]My poor records are gonna get torn to shreds.
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_03_LANGSTON_3468: [0.28-2.11]Would you two stop doing...[2.26-3.57]whatever it is you’re doing?[4.50-5.87]And I’m not “low-clearance”!
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_03_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3467: And I am required to inform you that the Astral Spike’s origins may be a confidential matter and should not be inquired upon by low-clearance personnel.
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_03_PANOPTICON_GUARD_2_3466: Sir, I am required to inform you that ALL records are property of the Bureau, not of any one individual.
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_04_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3470: [0.00-1.37]When it stops being funny.[1.62-2.78]Now shut up, he’ll hear you.
AMB_PAN_02_CONV_04_PANOPTICON_GUARD_2_3469: When are we gonna drop this whole robot act?
AMB_PAN_GEN_01_01_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3451: Sir, please remain wary of hostile entities as we continue to ensure your safety.
AMB_PAN_GEN_01_02_PANOPTICON_GUARD_2_3452: [0.03-3.47]This location’s safety is of critical importance to the Bureau.[3.85-5.39]It is an honor to protect it.
AMB_PAN_GEN_01_03_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3453: Resting whenever possible helps ease stress during crisis situations.
AMB_PAN_GEN_01_04_PANOPTICON_GUARD_2_3454: [0.03-4.57]The Oldest House was discovered on the fourth of August, 1964.[4.75-7.15]An interesting and enjoyable fact.[7.31-8.19]Ha, ha.
AMB_PAN_GEN_01_05_LANGSTON_3456: [0.73-1.40]No![1.79-3.17]What’s your guys’ deal?
AMB_PAN_GEN_01_05_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3455: [0.03-5.52]The employee manual offers a series of helpful actions to assist in mitigating a crisis.[5.83-7.65]Would you like me to list them for you?
AMB_PAN_GEN_02_01_PANOPTICON_GUARD_2_3471: [0.08-3.34]Remember to consume sufficient nutrients, sir.[3.66-6.78]Proper calorific intake is important.
AMB_PAN_GEN_02_02_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3472: Removing specialized Bureau tools from the premises is a class B violation.
AMB_PAN_GEN_02_03_LANGSTON_3474: [0.17-0.61]What?[0.64-1.06]No.[1.26-1.90]Yes.[2.16-2.85]Stop it.
AMB_PAN_GEN_02_03_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3473: [0.03-1.89]Sir, are you feeling threatened?[2.20-4.00]Is our presence reassuring?
AMB_PAN_GEN_02_04_PANOPTICON_GUARD_1_3475: [0.03-3.94]Seemingly harmless objects may actually be Altered Items.[4.20-5.01]Use care.
AMB_PAN_GEN_02_05_LANGSTON_3477: [0.07-0.91]That’s...[1.28-2.12]great.[2.49-3.29]Thank you.
AMB_PAN_GEN_02_05_PANOPTICON_GUARD_2_3476: [0.05-3.08]Guarding your life is a great privilege, sir.[3.23-6.08]We are both pleased with our assignment.
AMB_RU_CONV_01_UNDERHILL_3394: [0.11-2.39]I suppose there are benefits to an emergency.[3.21-4.39]Fewer disruptions.[5.09-6.50]More time for concentration.
AMB_RU_CONV_01_UNDERHILL_3395: [0.03-3.89]Significant research has shown the positive effects of talking to plants.[3.89-7.03]I wonder if they talk back in ways we cannot hear.
AMB_RU_CONV_01_UNDERHILL_3396: [0.07-1.56]The light in here could be better.[2.77-4.76]I should requisition another fluorescent.
AMB_RU_CONV_02_UNDERHILL_3400: [0.19-4.12]Do us a favor and make sure Ranger Dee and Ranger Dumb are still out there.[4.41-7.62]I’d hate to have a Hiss walk into my lab and mess around with the samples.
AMB_RU_CONV_02_UNDERHILL_3401: [0.15-2.81]In all this, I find myself enjoying the work even more.[4.28-5.74]Does that make me strange, I wonder?
AMB_RU_CONV_02_UNDERHILL_3402: Back again, Director?
AMB_RU_CONV_02_UNDERHILL_3403: Note to self: Request lock for laboratory door.
AMB_RU_CONV_03_UNDERHILL_3404: [0.07-3.77]This "Clog" sample Arish brought me is simply fascinating.[4.03-7.05]And to think Darling protested tapping a Threshold.
AMB_RU_CONV_03_UNDERHILL_3405: [0.20-2.26]Those Hiss certainly have a way with words.[2.85-4.03]Almost like poetry.[4.95-6.26]A Comedy of Menace...[7.17-8.58]from the Pinter dimension.
AMB_RU_CONV_03_UNDERHILL_3406: [0.07-1.95]A skosh of metal salt?[2.38-3.31]Skosh?[4.08-6.72]Really, Darling, use standard units.
AMB_RU_FAREWELLS_UNDERHILL_3384: Do try to survive out there.
AMB_RU_FAREWELLS_UNDERHILL_3385: No need to hurry back.
AMB_RU_FAREWELLS_UNDERHILL_3386: Goodbye for now.
AMB_RU_FAREWELLS_UNDERHILL_3387: Director.
AMB_RU_FAREWELLS_UNDERHILL_3388: I'll get back to more important things.
AMB_RU_FAREWELLS_UNDERHILL_3389: This work won't finish itself... or perhaps it might...
AMB_RU_FAREWELLS_UNDERHILL_3390: Are we finished then?
AMB_RU_FAREWELLS_UNDERHILL_3391: Back to it then.
AMB_RU_FAREWELLS_UNDERHILL_3392: Why not return when you have something important to say.
AMB_RU_FAREWELLS_UNDERHILL_3393: Let’s carry on then.
AMB_RU_GENERICS_UNDERHILL_3407: (frustrated grumble)
AMB_RU_GENERICS_UNDERHILL_3408: [0.27-0.85]What?[1.85-3.22]No, no.[4.09-5.73]Not that...[6.97-8.07]But maybe?
AMB_RU_GENERICS_UNDERHILL_3409: (thinking noises)
AMB_RU_GENERICS_UNDERHILL_3410: [0.53-1.55]Could be.[2.94-3.49]If only...
AMB_RU_GENERICS_UNDERHILL_3411: (frustrated sigh)
AMB_RU_GENERICS_UNDERHILL_3412: (humming a glam rock song)
AMB_RU_GREETINGS_UNDERHILL_3374: Director Faden.
AMB_RU_GREETINGS_UNDERHILL_3375: Is this really the best use of your time?
AMB_RU_GREETINGS_UNDERHILL_3376: What is it then?
AMB_RU_GREETINGS_UNDERHILL_3377: [0.05-0.97]Keep it short...[1.50-1.92]Please.
AMB_RU_GREETINGS_UNDERHILL_3378: Don’t mind me.
AMB_RU_GREETINGS_UNDERHILL_3379: Come to visit, Director?
AMB_RU_GREETINGS_UNDERHILL_3380: They must'nt keep you very busy up there.
AMB_RU_GREETINGS_UNDERHILL_3381: What do you require?
AMB_RU_GREETINGS_UNDERHILL_3382: [0.12-0.93]Good afternoon.[2.17-3.01]Or is it morning?
AMB_RU_GREETINGS_UNDERHILL_3383: Yes?
AMB_SA_CONV_01_ARISH_3347: [0.17-3.30]Blockages in pipes C through F...[4.14-5.99]Is the Clog back?[5.99-6.40]Now?[7.31-9.75]God, Ahti’s gonna be so pissed.
AMB_SA_CONV_02_ARISH_3348: What’s your read on all this?
AMB_SA_CONV_02_ARISH_3350: [0.10-1.12]Thanks, Frank.[1.77-2.55]Real positive.
AMB_SA_CONV_02_MAINTENANCE_WORKER_2_3349: [0.35-4.03]Energy conversion is well below the acceptable percentage.[4.23-8.41]Internal pressure is climbing so fast I’m amazed the NSC is still holding.[8.58-10.90]When it blows, we’re all going with it.
AMB_SA_CONV_03_ARISH_3351: [0.05-0.44]Medic![0.52-1.10]What’s the damage?
AMB_SA_CONV_03_ARISH_3353: [0.05-0.32]Oh yeah?[0.32-3.99]Well they’re gonna have to be, 'cause we are moving out and I am not leaving them behind.[4.34-5.12]Now do what you need to do.
AMB_SA_CONV_03_ATLAS_RANGER_MEDIC_3352: [0.06-1.32]They’ve each taken a few hits.[1.63-5.51]We need to get them to a surgical station ASAP, but I don’t think they’re stable enough to move.
AMB_SA_CONV_04_ARISH_3354: [0.08-2.91]Hey, remember the deal: you kill a Hiss, I buy a shot.[3.30-4.33]Bottom shelf only, though.
AMB_SA_CONV_05_ARISH_3355: [0.21-3.13]Oh my god, did she have to write everything in her made-up gibberish code?[3.47-6.58]Fucking Marshall with her CIA spy shit, god.
AMB_SA_CONV_06_ARISH_3356: We gotta be methodical, clean out every last Hiss with one thorough sweep, room by room.
AMB_SA_CONV_06_ARISH_3357: [0.12-5.25]But if there’s a Building Shift and even one gets behind our line, then...[6.15-8.07]Fuck, this place is a pain in the ass sometimes.
AMB_SA_CONV_07_ARISH_3358: Any luck finding the armory?
AMB_SA_CONV_07_ARISH_3360: [0.47-0.83]Fuck![0.83-2.01]Whose side is the House on?[2.89-4.06]Alright, well keep your teams looking.[4.54-6.97]And post a watch on the old location, just in case it shifts back.[7.47-8.69]We need that fucking ammo.
AMB_SA_CONV_07_LUCK_RANGER_1_3359: [0.00-0.37]None.[0.80-2.12]Looks like it got shifted.[2.43-4.06]We have Rangers checking each sector.
AMB_SA_CONV_08_ARISH_3361: [0.06-2.07]I found a file on the old Director, Northmoor.[2.84-4.03]It didn't list any date of death.[4.64-5.22]You...[5.89-6.87]You know anything about that?
AMB_SA_CONV_08_ARISH_3363: Yeah, maybe.
AMB_SA_CONV_08_LUCK_RANGER_1_3362: [0.06-0.82]Could be an error?[1.26-4.84]The records staff process a lot of data, maybe it just slipped through.
AMB_SA_CONV_09_ARISH_3364: I need the containment protocols for every Altered Item or Object of Power with an audio-related effect.
AMB_SA_CONV_09_ARISH_3366: Tell him that the Hiss work through sound, so any countermeasures designed for similar Altered Items should be considered for field use.
AMB_SA_CONV_09_LUCK_RANGER_1_3365: [0.21-2.98]I’ll send a team to contact Langston and get that information, sir.[3.38-5.16]If he asks why, what do we tell him?
AMB_SA_FAREWELLS_ARISH_3337: Go get some Hiss.
AMB_SA_FAREWELLS_ARISH_3338: I'll be seeing you.
AMB_SA_FAREWELLS_ARISH_3339: See you soon.
AMB_SA_FAREWELLS_ARISH_3340: Stay sharp, Faden.
AMB_SA_FAREWELLS_ARISH_3341: Stop by any time.
AMB_SA_FAREWELLS_ARISH_3342: All right, back to work.
AMB_SA_FAREWELLS_ARISH_3343: Watch yourself out there.
AMB_SA_FAREWELLS_ARISH_3344: Don’t get sloppy out there.
AMB_SA_FAREWELLS_ARISH_3345: We’re gonna get through this.
AMB_SA_FAREWELLS_ARISH_3346: Remember: we’ve got this.
AMB_SA_GENERICS_ARISH_3367: Fuck, if they’re in there, and we go around that way...
AMB_SA_GENERICS_ARISH_3368: Two squads lost... Christ...
AMB_SA_GENERICS_ARISH_3369: [0.12-3.21]How did I get saddled with this job?[3.21-4.64]Where the fuck did Marshall go?
AMB_SA_GENERICS_ARISH_3370: The Hiss just keep coming, man...
AMB_SA_GENERICS_ARISH_3371: [0.18-3.16]I can’t believe the emergency rations don’t include beer...[3.16-5.37]Fucking thirsty!
AMB_SA_GENERICS_ARISH_3372: What a fucking day...
AMB_SA_GREETINGS_ARISH_3327: Hey there, Faden.
AMB_SA_GREETINGS_ARISH_3328: What’s the word, Faden?
AMB_SA_GREETINGS_ARISH_3329: How are ya?
AMB_SA_GREETINGS_ARISH_3330: You need something?
AMB_SA_GREETINGS_ARISH_3331: What can I do to help?
AMB_SA_GREETINGS_ARISH_3332: What’s new?
AMB_SA_GREETINGS_ARISH_3333: Good to have you back.
AMB_SA_GREETINGS_ARISH_3334: How’s it looking out there?

CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_118: Fair warning:
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_119: You called me, so here I am.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_121: I know I shut you out sometimes.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_123: It’s just that I get my hopes up.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_124: It’s like, we live in a room, and there’s a poster on the wall.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_125: The picture’s something nice, a landscape, a famous person.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_126: The room’s a cell.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_127: But it’s all a lie.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_128: There’s a hole hidden behind that poster that leads to the real world.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_129: And the ones that see it happen, freak out, and try to forget what they saw.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_135: I’m here.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7138: This is gonna be weirder than usual.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7139: Can’t be helped.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7140: I'm always glad to hear from you.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7141: So many times, it’s led to nothing.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7142: I found nothing. 
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7143: Why did you bring me here?
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7145: We stare at it and we think that’s the whole world, the room and the poster.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7150: Like in that movie, what is it called, the prison movie?
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7151: And the picture, it’s different for each of us.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7152: It can be beautiful or terrible, but we’re all transfixed.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7155: Something to distract us from the truth.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7156: We’re lying to ourselves.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7157: They’re lying to us.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7159: The room’s not the world, the world is much bigger and much stranger.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7161: But sometimes, sometimes, something crawls out from behind the poster.
CINE_1_01_100_JESSE_7162: We all feel safe in that room.

CINE_1_01_200_DARLING_182: Now, the Service Weapon is of course a prime example of an O.o.P.
CINE_1_01_200_DARLING_7302: A very powerful one, ingrained in the Bureau’s DNA, a key component in our Prime Candidate program:

CINE_1_01_300_JESSE_7167: It’s the dead man.
CINE_1_01_300_JESSE_7169: And this gun’s alive.

CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_311: Why am I here?
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_312: What scares me shitless, is that I finally found it.
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_7180: I’m not a director type, not a leader.
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_7181: I think you already know.
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_7183: Yes, I came for my brother.
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_7185: I’m not looking for proof, this is already it, more than enough.
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_7187: I said I was looking for answers, but I might never understand them.
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_7188: No matter what they told me all those years.
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_7189: I didn’t imagine this.
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_7190: I know it’s real now.
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_7191: I want to be a part of this world. 
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_7193: Only to see the Hiss destroy it all.
CINE_1_01_700_JESSE_7306: But that’s not me.

CINE_1_02_100_JESSE_6503: The Board’s in charge here.
CINE_1_02_100_JESSE_7194: It's like the channel's been changed. 
CINE_1_02_100_JESSE_7195: Their pyramid's in the Bureau seal.
CINE_1_02_100_JESSE_7196: I'm not their director.

CINE_1_02_500_DARLING_7272: It doesn’t connect to any typical network.
CINE_1_02_500_DARLING_7273: A direct line to the Astral Plane and the Board,

CINE_1_03_400_JESSE_489: Marshall is the next step. 
CINE_1_03_400_JESSE_7284: What Emily told me, about Ordinary,
CINE_1_03_400_JESSE_7285: my powers being connected to things in the Bureau’s past.

CINE_1_10_100_ARISH_1494: The Bureau’s the best at what it does:
CINE_1_10_100_ARISH_7203: Protecting everyday Americans from foreign threats.
CINE_1_10_100_LANGSTON: 
CINE_1_10_100_LANGSTON_1493: I need those field reports typed up
CINE_1_10_100_LANGSTON_7202: and in management’s hands first thing tomorrow.
CINE_1_10_100_POPE: 
CINE_1_10_100_POPE_1492: Federal Bureau of Control,
CINE_1_10_100_POPE_1496: There’s the new girl.
CINE_1_10_100_POPE_7198: Standing around day dreaming
CINE_1_10_100_POPE_7199: Who the hell does she think she is?
CINE_1_10_100_POPE_7200: when she should be getting work done.
CINE_1_10_100_POPE_7201: The Director?
CINE_1_10_100_POPE_7204: how may I help you?
CINE_1_10_200_JESSE: 
CINE_1_10_200_JESSE_1571: What?
CINE_1_10_200_JESSE_1572: No!
CINE_1_10_200_JESSE_7127: What is happening?
CINE_1_10_200_JESSE_7128: I don’t like this. 
CINE_1_10_200_JESSE_7129: This isn’t me! I’m not me!
CINE_1_10_200_JESSE_7130: I can’t...
CINE_1_10_200_JESSE_7132: Why can’t I feel you?

CINE_1_10_300_JESSE: 
CINE_1_10_300_JESSE_1603: I won’t let them win.
CINE_1_10_300_JESSE_1604: That’s how it happened.
CINE_1_10_300_JESSE_1605: I have to remember:
CINE_1_10_300_JESSE_7133: The Hiss got Trench first.
CINE_1_10_300_JESSE_7134: He let them in.
CINE_1_10_300_JESSE_7135: He turned on the Projector.
CINE_1_10_300_JESSE_7136: the Hiss.
CINE_1_10_300_JESSE_7137: The Hiss is the enemy.
CINE_1_10_300_JESSE_V.O.: 
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING: 
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING_1636: Hello?
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING_1638: I have sad news.
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING_1639: You must go to my office.
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING_7402: This is Dr. Casper Darling.
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING_7403: I have a classified message for the Director of the Federal Bureau of Control. 
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING_7404: Hedron is gone now.
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING_7405: Do you understand?
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING_7406: But it was not a source, it was a catalyst.
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING_7407: The endgame.
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING_7408: It will be revealed.
CINE_1_10_400_DARLING_O.S. FROM THE HOTLINE: 
CINE_1_10_400_JESSE: 
CINE_1_10_400_JESSE_1634: I know what I must do.
CINE_1_10_400_JESSE_1635: I am the Director.
CINE_1_10_400_JESSE_7397: Start at the beginning.
CINE_1_10_400_JESSE_7398: This is my mess to clean up.
CINE_1_10_400_JESSE_7399: I should’ve seen it earlier.
CINE_1_10_400_JESSE_7400: No one else’s. 
CINE_1_10_400_JESSE_7401: My fight.
CINE_1_10_400_JESSE_V.O.: 
CINE_1_10_400_TRENCH: 
CINE_1_10_400_TRENCH_7068: You are a worm through time.
CINE_1_10_400_TRENCH_7069: Through a mirror, inverted is made right. Leave your-
CINE_1_10_400_TRENCH_7394: The thunder song distorts you.
CINE_1_10_400_TRENCH_7395: White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye. 
CINE_1_10_400_TRENCH_7396: Happiness comes.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE: 
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_1652: Hedron is dead, but you’re alive. Here. In me. 
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_1653: Maybe Hedron put you in our heads when we met her.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_1654: Trench was the first to be corrupted by the Hiss.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_1655: It was Trench who took the Projector to the Nostalgia Department.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_1656: With Hedron dead, the Hiss tried to corrupt me too.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_1657: They’re waiting.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_7385: Maybe you were always there, and she was just trying to teach me how to trigger you.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_7386: Maybe I don’t need to.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_7387: Maybe I’ll never understand.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_7388: Slowly, over the years.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_7389: His need for control only made it worse.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_7390: He opened the door to the Hiss, just like that.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_7391: But I’m stronger than them.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_7392: We’re stronger.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_7393: They’ll try to stop us.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_POLARIS: 
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_POLARIS_1650: Grow brighter.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_POLARIS_1651: Around one constant, they revolve.
CINE_1_10_600_JESSE_V.O.: 
CINE_1_10_800_DYLAN: 
CINE_1_10_800_DYLAN_1663: You are a worm through time.
CINE_1_10_800_DYLAN_7377: Leave your insides by the door.
CINE_1_10_800_DYLAN_7378: Happiness comes.
CINE_1_10_800_DYLAN_7379: Through a mirror, inverted is made right.
CINE_1_10_800_DYLAN_7380: White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye.
CINE_1_10_800_DYLAN_7381: The thunder song distorts you.
CINE_1_10_800_DYLAN_7382: You’ve always been the new you. 
CINE_1_10_800_DYLAN_7383: Push the fingers through the surface into the wet.
CINE_1_10_800_JESSE: 
CINE_1_10_800_JESSE_1664: I know he’s still there somewhere, locked inside.
CINE_1_10_800_JESSE_7384: I know because that’s how it was for me.
CINE_1_10_800_JESSE_V.O.: 
CINE_1_10_900_DYLAN: 
CINE_1_10_900_DYLAN_7070: The egg cracks and the truth will emerge out of you.
CINE_1_10_900_DYLAN_7370: You are home.
CINE_1_10_900_DYLAN_7371: You remind us of home.
CINE_1_10_900_DYLAN_7372: You've taken your boss with your boss with you. 
CINE_1_10_900_JESSE: 
CINE_1_10_900_JESSE_1665: Dylan’s in a coma.
CINE_1_10_900_JESSE_1666: The portal’s been closed, but the Hiss is still in the Oldest House...
CINE_1_10_900_JESSE_1667: I'm working on a solution with my management team, but there is still a long road ahead.
CINE_1_10_900_JESSE_1668: I’m the Director of the Federal Bureau of Control.
CINE_1_10_900_JESSE_7373: I don’t know if there’s anything of him left in there, if he’ll ever find his way back.
CINE_1_10_900_JESSE_7374: and the lockdown can’t be lifted as long as any trace of it remains.
CINE_1_10_900_JESSE_7375: We’re in this together.
CINE_1_10_900_JESSE_7376: You and I.

CINE_5_03_200_JESSE: 
CINE_5_03_200_JESSE_9289: The Nail is secure. The Hiss can’t touch it. I can’t undo the Astral bleeding in the Foundation, but at least it’s stopped.
CINE_5_03_200_JESSE_9292: I did. She’s gone.
CINE_5_03_200_JESSE_9293: She died thinking she’d saved the Bureau. Not a bad way to go.
CINE_5_03_200_JESSE_9294: I wasn’t ready for this crisis. I didn’t even see it coming.
CINE_5_03_200_JESSE_9295: But I promise I’ll be ready for the next one.
CINE_5_03_200_JESSE_9296: I mean, what good is a Director who can’t hold her Bureau together?
CINE_5_03_200_POPE: 
CINE_5_03_200_POPE_9290: Along with the seismic activity. You did it, Jesse.
CINE_5_03_200_POPE_9291: Did you ever find Marshall?
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE: 
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_10992: I feel... this feels familiar.

CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_10995: My name is Alan Wake.
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_10996: Who are you?
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_10997: Do I know you?
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_11000: The poet?
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_11001: The diver? You look different.
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_11003: Nothing holds still.
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_11005: Wait.
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_11006: There’s... something...

CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_9854: Writing?
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_9855: No.
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_9857: I-,I-, I don’t...
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_9858: It’s my double!
CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_9860: You’ve met him?

CINE_6_01_100_WAKE_O.S.: 
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE: 
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_10602: An artistic collaboration.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_10603: We’re working on this together, remember?
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_10998: Tom Zane.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_10999: There’s nothing to worry about.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_11002: The protagonist I played in my old film. 
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_11004: We found a way to escape. It will work this time.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_11009: I’m dealing with him.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_11010: It’s fine, my friend. Let me handle him.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_11011: You... you misunderstand me.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_9846: I’m your friend Tom.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_9848: That was just a... a role, a character.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_9849: I’m a film maker, an auteur like yourself.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_9850: You need a drink.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_9851: Kippis!
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_9853: But we’re very close now. You’ve been writing.
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_9856: You found a way!
CINE_6_01_100_ZANE_9859: Yeah yeah. Nothing to worry about.

CINE_6_03_100_WAKE_9933: I’ve forgotten.
CINE_6_03_100_WAKE_9934: He’s coming. I've got to get out of here. 
CINE_6_03_100_WAKE_9935: Dive deeper.
CINE_6_03_200_JESSE: 
CINE_6_03_200_JESSE_11012: But Investigations needs someone to run it.
CINE_6_03_200_JESSE_11013: Interested?
CINE_6_03_200_JESSE_11019: Are there agents onsite?
CINE_6_03_200_JESSE_9943: Hartman won’t be a problem anymore, Langston.
CINE_6_03_200_JESSE_9946: Maybe it was active before we went into lockdown?
CINE_6_03_200_JESSE_O.S.: 
CINE_6_03_200_LANGSTON: 
CINE_6_03_200_LANGSTON_11014: An AWE alert from Bright Falls, Washington.
CINE_6_03_200_LANGSTON_11015: There shouldn’t be any incoming signals.
CINE_6_03_200_LANGSTON_11016: And we’re in lockdown.
CINE_6_03_200_LANGSTON_11017: The date's all wrong, a couple of years in the future.
CINE_6_03_200_LANGSTON_11018: But it might be a glitch.
CINE_6_03_200_LANGSTON_11020: Agent Estevez is the field agent in charge of monitoring the site,
CINE_6_03_200_LANGSTON_11021: so she should be there to let us know
CINE_6_03_200_LANGSTON_11024: if the situation has been through any major changes recently...
CINE_6_03_200_LANGSTON_9944: I’ve seen what happens to sector heads, ma’am. No, thank you.
CINE_6_03_200_LANGSTON_9945: Ma’am? I’m getting something on my terminal here.

CINE_6_03_200_WAKE_9948: Things set in motion.
CINE_6_03_200_WAKE_9949: It’s happening again.

D1_AMB_HUB_010_CONV_02_POPE_9465: [0.25-3.15]All the tests I run on the Nail keep coming back as nonsense.[3.43-5.40]And a couple of my instruments have already broken.
D1_AMB_HUB_010_CONV_02_POPE_9467: [0.32-2.27]I didn’t take you for a quitter, Dr. Saba.[2.75-5.59]There’s a reason I packed a Black Rock-plated microscope!
D1_AMB_HUB_010_CONV_02_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9466: Maybe we should take that as a sign to pack it in.
D1_AMB_HUB_010_CONV_04_POPE_9472: [0.51-1.58]Planar displacement.[1.58-9.31]Your brain would split between two disparate dimensions, your consciousness ping-ponging back and forth as it struggles to decide who and what you are.
D1_AMB_HUB_010_CONV_04_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9471: What would happen if an Astral Bleed occurred right where we’re standing?
D1_AMB_HUB_010_CONV_04_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9473: I think I just threw up a little.
D1_AMB_HUB_010_EP_POPE_9474: [0.27-2.23]The name “Nail” implies it was stuck here.[2.23-5.27]But if that’s the case, who, or what, did it?
D1_AMB_HUB_010_EP_POPE_9476: [0.38-1.96]So the sand isn’t really sand.[1.96-4.02]It’s more like rusted iron powder.
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9479: [0.19-2.16]Does the Oldest House go deeper than this?[3.18-4.53]I mean, there’s gotta be a bottom.
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9480: [0.27-3.28]This place reminds of that cave we took the kids to last summer.[4.14-5.93]We really need to go on another vacation.
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9481: [0.10-2.01]I heard Pope saying Marshall’s down here.[2.53-3.78]Why hasn’t she reported in?
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9482: So the Oldest House broke a nail, huh?
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9483: [0.26-1.32]Astral Bleeding...[2.32-3.76]Is this what finally gets us?
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9484: [0.33-5.23]I saw the Director launch a Hiss at one of those flying Hiss, which then fell onto another Hiss.[5.23-7.95]It was like a symphony being conducted.
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9485: [0.43-1.52]I heard Marshall’s dead.[2.14-3.75]If that’s true, what chance do we have?
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9486: My throat feels all scratchy.
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9487: I hope nothing down here’s toxic.
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9488: Is the Astral Plane bleeding into our world, or are we bleeding into it?
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9489: I think I just felt the ground move.
D1_AMB_HUB_010_NPC_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9490: [0.24-1.70]Something does not want us here.[1.70-2.46]I can feel it.
D1_AMB_HUB_020_CONV_01_POPE_9491: [0.07-2.62]What do you make of the art on the walls down here?[2.96-4.87]I’m trying to work out possible origins.
D1_AMB_HUB_020_CONV_01_POPE_9493: [0.51-2.98]Darling always spoke very highly of you, Dr. Saba.[3.55-6.03]Would it hurt to try to be more helpful?
D1_AMB_HUB_020_CONV_01_POPE_9495: [0.78-2.07]The world’s always ending.[2.30-5.50]Maybe analyzing those readings I gave you will take your mind off it.
D1_AMB_HUB_020_CONV_01_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9492: Do I look like an expert in cave paintings?
D1_AMB_HUB_020_CONV_01_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9494: [0.34-0.92]Maybe.[1.84-4.20]You did give me a front row seat to the end of the world.
D1_AMB_HUB_020_EP_POPE_9496: [0.51-4.44]There’s always been a bit of a feud between Research and Operations.[5.24-7.20]Regardless, I hope Marshall is okay.[8.05-9.13]The Bureau needs her.
D1_AMB_HUB_020_EP_POPE_9498: [0.42-2.00]The Nail is nearly complete.[2.68-4.89]I can’t wait to see what happens when it’s reassembled.
D1_AMB_HUB_020_EP_POPE_9499: Hopefully nothing bad.
D1_AMB_HUB_020_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9500: How come we’ve never heard of this place?
D1_AMB_HUB_020_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9501: [0.21-3.09]First Hiss and now Astral Plane monsters.[3.48-4.46]What’s next?[4.85-5.80]Lizard people?
D1_AMB_HUB_020_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9502: [0.29-2.48]I wasn’t trained to go into the Astral Plane.[3.39-4.56]Not that anyone cares.
D1_AMB_HUB_020_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9503: If this situation’s so dire, why isn’t Arish here with us?
D1_AMB_HUB_020_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9504: Has anyone taken air quality samples down here?
D1_AMB_HUB_020_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9505: [0.10-1.87]What if I’m allergic to the Astral Plane?[2.20-2.98]Is that possible?
D1_AMB_HUB_020_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9506: (coughs)
D1_AMB_HUB_020_NPC_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9507: [0.82-2.50]Just focus on the data.[3.29-6.19]Don’t think about the various ways you could die or discorporate.
D1_AMB_HUB_020_NPC_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9508: [0.31-2.81]Who complains about their dad in research notes?[3.86-5.98]This Dr. Ash guy had some baggage.
D1_AMB_HUB_025_CONV_01_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9511: Uh, is everything okay out there, Director?
D1_AMB_HUB_025_CONV_01_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9512: [0.23-1.27]Not gonna lie.[1.96-3.95]Those earthquakes are making me a little uneasy.
D1_AMB_HUB_025_CONV_01_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9513: [0.21-1.35]I don’t want to die in a cave-in.[1.78-3.90]That’s like top three worst ways to die.
D1_AMB_HUB_025_CONV_01_POPE_9510: [0.71-3.19]Bureau researchers do NOT panic, Dr. Saba![3.48-6.37]Keep monitoring those tremors and get me some actionable data.
D1_AMB_HUB_025_CONV_01_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9509: [1.14-1.57]See?[1.94-3.84]I told you we were going to die down here!
D1_AMB_HUB_030_CONV_02_POPE_9521: [0.80-1.30]Hmm.[1.82-5.00]Interesting theory, but look at this place’s age.[5.44-10.17]The Foundation is likely still a part of the House, but is simply so old that it’s stopped growing.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_CONV_02_POPE_9523: You make it sound like it’s not.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_CONV_02_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9520: [0.47-3.65]I’ve been trying to figure out why building shifts don’t occur down here.[4.30-8.45]My best guess: the Foundation isn’t technically the House?
D1_AMB_HUB_030_CONV_02_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9522: You make it sound like it’s alive.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_CONV_03_POPE_9525: [0.82-4.34]Well, the Director says she saw her alive, but who knows.[4.95-10.78]She could be alive, dead, or in some post-material state having coffee with Dr. Darling.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_CONV_03_POPE_9527: [0.73-1.24]You’re right.[1.70-3.83]They wouldn’t stop arguing long enough to drink coffee.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_CONV_03_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9524: [0.50-3.04]Do you think Marshall really is dead, Dr. Pope?
D1_AMB_HUB_030_CONV_03_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9526: I think we can rule one of those out.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_EP_POPE_9536: [0.10-4.08]We have direct physical access to the Astral Plane through the remaining bleeds.[4.54-6.50]Think of all the experiments we can perform![6.50-8.55]I’m gonna need a bigger clipboard.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_EP_POPE_9537: Note to self: Collect tissue samples from that Ranger who keeps coughing.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_EP_POPE_9538: [0.61-2.18]The Astral Bleed has clotted.[2.71-3.07]Hm[3.46-4.25]Solidified?[5.05-6.09]Stabilized?[7.15-7.83]Congealed?[9.26-10.20]Congealed’s not bad.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9542: How many more Hiss do we need to kill before the lockdown is lifted?
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9543: I miss my kids.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9544: [0.18-1.67]I can’t believe Marshall’s dead.[2.46-4.06]She held us together through so much.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9545: I wonder what will happen to us Rangers now that Marshall’s gone.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9546: [0.30-2.14]Thought there’d be more action down here.[2.77-3.87]Not that I’m complaining.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9547: [0.26-2.92]Is Frank still complaining about his allergies?[3.34-6.38]God, typical Frank.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9548: [0.25-1.72]I miss sunlight.[2.59-6.58]These vitamin D supplements are absolutely not cutting it.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9549: Even after we get out of the House, I’m still gonna be scared to take off this HRA.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9550: [0.22-2.06]I’m definitely coming down with something.[2.69-5.61]I told HR I shouldn’t be assigned to damp areas.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9551: I should ask Arish about that desk job again.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9552: [0.31-2.22]The growth of the crystals isn’t random.[3.12-6.26]There’s an intention behind the movement, a pattern.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9553: [0.13-1.88]Pope is even more fearless than Darling.[1.88-4.20]I wouldn’t have guessed that.
D1_AMB_HUB_030_NPC_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9554: [0.47-4.24]This report by Dr. Ash directly contradicts the Service Weapon case file.[5.26-7.06]Why were they hiding facts from the Bureau?
D1_AMB_HUB_EP_FAREWELLS_POPE_9457: We don’t know what’s out there, so please try to be careful.
D1_AMB_HUB_EP_FAREWELLS_POPE_9459: Don’t be a stranger.
D1_AMB_HUB_EP_GREETINGS_POPE_9454: Fascinating place, isn’t it?
D1_AMB_HUB_EP_GREETINGS_POPE_9455: If it isn’t my favorite Director.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_FAREWELLS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9571: [0.22-1.11]Thanks for stopping...[1.65-3.94]well, whatever was going on down here.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_FAREWELLS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9572: We’re proud to fight beside you, Director Faden.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_FAREWELLS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9573: [0.78-2.20]Sorry to hear about Marshall.[3.44-4.95]I bet she went down fighting though.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_FAREWELLS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9574: Let us know how we can help, Director.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_FAREWELLS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9575: [0.18-1.91]The guys were saying something about Marshall.[2.32-3.08]Is she okay?
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_FAREWELLS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9576: Listen, I’m not feeling too- never mind, you look busy.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_FAREWELLS_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9577: [0.16-2.14]Thank you for stopping the Astral Bleed.[3.39-4.49]I can relax now.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_FAREWELLS_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9578: [0.15-2.56]You and Dr. Pope did some amazing work here.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9555: Director Faden.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9556: It’s the Director!
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9557: We got your back, Director.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_1_9558: Give us a call on the radios if you need help out there, Director.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9559: Pleasure to fight with you, Director Faden.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9560: [0.19-2.07]Hey, try not to launch me, Director.[2.79-3.72]I’m just kidding.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9562: [0.47-2.03]I know you’ll take care of this, Director.[2.79-3.50]I’m not worried.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_2_9563: You’ve got this, Director!
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9564: I can’t believe I get to work with the Director.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9565: It’s an honor, Director.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9566: Director Faden.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_DLC_HUB_RANGER_3_9567: We’ve got this area covered, Director.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9568: So, that’s Director Faden.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9569: Oh, hello, Director.
D1_AMB_HUB_NPC_GREETINGS_RESEARCH_ASSISTANT_9570: Director.
D1_AMB_M2_PA_VOICE_9446: [0.03-0.61]Warning![1.04-3.34]Altered Item detected in transport bay.[4.11-7.55]Access is prohibited per safety regulation 18.A.
D1_AMB_M2_PA_VOICE_9447: [0.35-1.41]Power restored.[2.11-4.99]Resume Altered Item transport at designated terminal.
D1_AMB_M2_PA_VOICE_9448: [0.23-2.18]Altered Item transport in progress.[2.60-4.47]Please stand back from the moving platform.
D1_AMB_M2_PA_VOICE_9449: [0.22-2.52]No altered material detected in area.[3.12-5.02]Personnel may now safely enter.
D1_AMB_M2_PA_VOICE_9450: Have a Bureau-ful day.
D1_GEN_01_JESSE_9298: This will make things a lot easier.
D1_GEN_01_JESSE_9299: [0.08-1.66]Anti-crystal bullets.[2.28-3.07]Cool.
D1_GEN_01_JESSE_9300: [0.00-1.17]Ha ha![1.21-4.44]I am Jesse Faden, Master of Rocks!
D1_GEN_01_JESSE_9301: [0.42-1.35]Whoa![1.60-2.81]It moves like...[2.99-3.65]water.
D1_GEN_02_JESSE_9302: [0.03-1.51]Are these Pope’s Rangers?[2.20-3.36]What happened to them?
D1_GEN_02_JESSE_9303: That’s unsettling.
D1_GEN_02_JESSE_9304: [0.00-2.90]Now there are Astral Plane monsters coming through?[3.87-5.22]This is getting out of hand.
D1_GEN_02_JESSE_9305: [0.00-0.79]Great.[1.20-3.20]More monsters getting in my Bureau.[3.66-5.23]I need to hurry up and stop this.
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9306: Whoa!
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9307: Hey!
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9308: [0.00-1.45]I’m in the Astral Plane?[2.30-4.59]This bleed is just getting worse and worse.
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9309: [0.03-1.44]And now the floor’s giving out.[1.89-5.32]If I don’t hurry, the Astral Plane will consume the entire building.
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9310: [0.03-1.35]That’s the cave sand.[1.84-4.00]Looks like the Astral Bleed goes both ways.
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9311: [0.09-2.52]Finally the Astral Plane is getting some color.[3.42-5.64]Endless white voids can get a little repetitive.
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9312: [0.00-1.86]Hiss in the Astral Plane?[2.85-4.45]That didn’t go so well last time.
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9313: So the Hiss are back in the Astral Plane. Well, we stopped them once...
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9314: I guess the Board was ready for the Hiss this time.
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9315: Nice to see someone else handling the Hiss for once.
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9316: [0.09-1.15]A Control Point?[1.33-1.98]Here?[2.48-3.13]That’s handy.
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9317: [0.00-1.06]A Control Point![1.23-3.66]Finally the Astral Bleed has an upside!
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9318: They’re bringing in the big guns, huh?
D1_GEN_03_JESSE_9319: You guys should really know when to quit.
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9320: [0.00-1.88]This is part of the Containment Sector?[2.26-3.42]What’s it doing down here?
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9321: [0.00-1.52]This area looks...[1.59-2.22]newer.[2.63-4.29]Is it from the upper floors?
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9322: There’s something behind that Hiss Barrier.
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9323: [0.00-1.02]Hiss nodes.[1.41-2.47]Better take them out.
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9324: Someone call a plumber!
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9325: Glad no one was around to hear that.
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9326: [0.03-1.62]So that’s the Altered Item.[2.04-3.09]Looks pretty secure.
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9327: [0.03-1.23]A movie camera?[1.23-3.89]I wonder what weird stuff that does.
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9328: Way to tempt fate, Jesse.
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9329: [0.00-0.71]No power.[1.04-1.53]Typical.
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9330: [0.03-1.92]Hmm, something’s broken.[2.99-4.19]Where’s Ahti when you need him?
D1_GEN_04_JESSE_9331: I should hire someone who builds smaller machines.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9332: [0.00-2.27]That power core must open the door.[3.06-4.32]But how do I reach it?
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9333: [0.00-1.02]The gate’s powered down.[1.66-3.10]Got to be some way to get it working.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9334: [0.00-0.64]Whoa.[1.08-2.28]That’s a tall lab.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9335: Who built that?
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9336: This elevator’s seen better days...
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9337: That elevator looks like it’s gonna need some fixing up.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9338: [0.00-2.47]It’s working, but won’t go any higher.[2.50-5.49]I wonder if I can charge it up somehow?
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9339: [0.23-1.99]Hm, won’t go up.[2.30-3.72]Maybe I need to give it some juice?
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9340: [0.03-0.94]A Hiss Barrier.[1.66-2.95]There must be nodes around.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9341: [0.00-1.68]That Hiss Barrier is in my way.[2.04-3.08]Let’s take out the nodes.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9342: The Nail looks different now.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9343: The Nail repaired itself a bit.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9344: [0.00-1.07]The rituals are working.[1.44-2.97]The Nail’s looking much better.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9345: [0.00-0.97]The Nail’s looking better.[1.38-2.73]Fewer broken chunks.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9346: [0.03-1.64]The Nail’s nearly whole again.[2.24-3.45]Guess the rituals are working.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9347: [0.00-2.23]The Nail is almost entirely fixed.[2.54-3.19]Nearly done.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9348: [0.00-0.89]The Nail’s whole.[1.16-2.54]This shouldn’t be happening.
D1_GEN_05_JESSE_9349: [0.00-1.12]The Nail is whole.[1.61-3.99]So why is everything going haywire?
D1_GEN_06_JESSE_9350: [0.00-1.59]Where did this hole come from?[2.05-3.06]And where’s it go?
D1_GEN_06_JESSE_9351: Only one way to find out.
D1_GEN_06_JESSE_9352: This place goes even deeper? 
D1_GEN_06_JESSE_9353: Guess I’d better follow the rabbit hole.
D1_GEN_06_JESSE_9354: Did the tremors open this hole or did the Nail?
D1_GEN_06_JESSE_9355: What’s with all these crystals?
D1_GEN_06_JESSE_9356: [0.26-0.63]Ugh.[0.63-1.76]I don’t have time for this.

D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_01_MARSHALL_8903: I only heard of the Foundation when I became Head of Operations.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_01_MARSHALL_8904: I have to stop the Hiss from finding this place. I’m the only one who can.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_01_MARSHALL_9756: The very bottom of the Oldest House, Director access only. Just the name alone is classified.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_01_MARSHALL_9757: Zachariah gave me a tour the day I was promoted. Said I should see it for myself.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_01_MARSHALL_9758: To understand. After that, I snuck down on my own from time to time, to keep tabs on the place.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_01_MARSHALL_9759: And on them. But nothing ever changed down there, not even the walls.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_01_MARSHALL_9760: It’s solid, permanent, different from the rest of the House.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_01_MARSHALL_9761: Of course, they were always watching me. I never stayed long. I’m not stupid.

D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL: 
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_8954: I’ve served under two Directors. Three now, I suppose.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_8955: Becoming Director is a formal process overseen by the Board. Lots of ritual and mystery.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_8956: Besides, I work better alone.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_9762: Trench and I worked our way up together.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_9763: We made it through the tough cases, the bad days, the casualties.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_9764: He was the epitome of a good agent. Smart, decisive, selfless.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_9765: Then he picked up that damn gun...
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_9766: After that, key staff provide detailed briefs on all classified matters, past and present.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_9767: But with Faden... well, there’s no protocol for field promotion.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_9768: The girl’s smart, has a good head on her shoulders.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_9769: I’m trusting her to handle the Hiss upstairs while I hold them off here.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_02_MARSHALL_9770: All this shit with the Nail, the Board... I’m not sure she’s ready.

D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL: 
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_8992: I snuck into the Foundation through a backdoor I know.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_8993: I had to put on a brave face up there, but this situation is the worst I’ve ever seen.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_8994: But I still have a job to do. Keep the Hiss back.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_9771: Had to get ahead of the Hiss. Just a matter of bypassing the ritual protections.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_9773: We’re getting back on our feet, but we’ve already lost so much.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_9774: Trench is dead, Darling is... somewhere. I’m the only one left.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_9775: There’s not enough HRAs to spare, so I’ll have to make do with what I’ve got.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_9776: Frankly, I don’t even know what will happen if the Hiss take the Nail.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_9777: Trench made it sound like it’d be the end of the world.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_9778: Well, orders are orders, even if they come from a dead man.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_9791: Luckily, the Board’s as distracted as the rest of the Bureau.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_03_MARSHALL_9792: He was never one to exaggerate.

D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL: 
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL_9060: The Hiss got in. The Foundation is overrun. I was out of time and out of options.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL_9061: Trench wouldn’t be thrilled.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL_9062: Bullshit. Those years spent in the Director’s chair warped his priorities.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL_9063: But I did my duty. The Hiss can’t corrupt a pile of smoking rubble.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL_9779: I took all the C4 I could get my hands on and strapped it to the Nail. Boom.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL_9780: A desperate move, but it’s better off in pieces than in enemy hands.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL_9781: He always said how vital the Nail was, how it was the Bureau’s duty to protect it.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL_9782: In the end, he valued order over people, the advice of invisible voices over that of old friends.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL_9783: He lost sight of who he was. The Board made sure of that.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL_9784: My last act as Head of Operations. I’m done. 
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_04_MARSHALL_9785: At least I could take those bastards down with me.

D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_05_MARSHALL: 
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_05_MARSHALL_9257: I tried to get out after the detonation, but the Astral Spike came out of nowhere.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_05_MARSHALL_9258: Christ, what a mess.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_05_MARSHALL_9259: But I stopped the Hiss. I did it.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_05_MARSHALL_9260: Jesse has good reason to hate the Bureau. But that could be what we need right now.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_05_MARSHALL_9261: So, Director Faden, here’s my last lesson: You can’t save everybody.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_05_MARSHALL_9786: I escaped, but my HRA was damaged. I’d bet a year’s salary the Board sent it. We never did see eye to eye.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_05_MARSHALL_9787: They have too much control. Over Trench, the Bureau, the House. They make themselves part of every important process.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_05_MARSHALL_9788: Nothing a little C4 can’t fix. Two birds, one bomb.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_05_MARSHALL_9789: If Faden did her part then the Bureau is safe, until the next thing.
D1_HOTLINE_MARSHALL_05_MARSHALL_9790: She won’t follow the same path, won’t fall into the same traps. She’ll lead her way.

D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9369: My life’s been a strange one.
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9370: Certainly stranger than I’d like.
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9371: But this place... it’s something else.
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9372: The floors crawl, the walls slither. It’s a shifting pit.
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9373: On the street, it’s just another drab building, standing there for anyone to see. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9374: Northmoor--
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9375: They’re evidence that I’m at least trying to understand.
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9376: He always hated irony.
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9377: And look at me, his bookworm son, the supposed Head of Research, 
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9631: But no one does. How did we miss it?
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9632: He’ll expect answers, which is why I’m making these tapes.
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9633: Acting Director Northmoor now, is on a train from Washington. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9634: Father searched his entire life for something like this and we find it one week after he’s buried.
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9635: Of course, Father, the great Director Ash, would’ve been the first man in. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_01_ASH_9636: who can’t stop his legs from shaking long enough to step over the threshold.

D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9378: It’s been five days since we first entered the building. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9379: Northmoor even made a discovery. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9380: The strangest thing? There was no pedestal in front of that pillar a day ago. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9637: but we did manage to find a lower cavern that seems structurally predictable-
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9638: Traversing the interior is dangerous due to the shifting,
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9639: which is a scientific way of saying its walls won’t crush us in our sleep.
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9640: A pistol, placed on a stone pedestal in front of that strange ebony pillar. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9641: Seems like something out of a storybook, except the heroes usually find swords, not handguns. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9642: But it is the perfect lure for someone like him. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9643: Hours after finding this weapon, Northmoor cornered me to spout some nonsense about how the “Board” had made him the Director. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9644: He ranted about the title being meaningless before now, 
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9645: calling Father and all other previous directors shams, frauds, and worse. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9646: I think this place is worse for Northmoor than it is for me.
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9647: This building has swallowed a dozen of my men, and now it’s handing out presents? 
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9648:  Is it playing some sort of game? If it is, we’re most certainly losing.
D1_OPCON_ASH_02_ASH_9649: Hell, we don’t even know the rules.

D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9382: Twenty-eight days now spent inside what we’re calling the “Oldest House”. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9383: Per orders, me and my research team have established a permanent examination lab in the Foundation. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9384: I spend my days investigating that odd pillar where Northmoor found the handgun. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9385: I started building something, equal parts talisman and technology. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9386: I prefer to work away from the pillar.
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9650: Northmoor insists on the name. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9651:  I’m too tired to ask why. I’m not sleeping well.
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9652: I basically live down here now, like the obedient Head of Research Father raised me to be.
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9653: The work was half-hearted at first, I admit, 
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9654: but then I discovered numerous non-Aristotelian energy channels converging at its base.
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9655: Leylines, dragon roads, Heilige Linien, call them what you want, but this pillar is the crossroads.
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9657: An array that can impose order on the ley junctions. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_03_ASH_9658: That’s the idea at least. We’ll see when I’m done.

D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9390: They aren’t hostile.
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9391: What are the Id? Residents? Prisoners? 
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9392: I know I shouldn’t, but I gave them names.
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9661: My research staff complain of a presence watching them.
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9662: Many have suffered nervous fits. Some were evacuated.
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9663: I met them while exploring the deeper caves. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9664: They’re hard to describe, but imagine avant-garde sculptures of humans.
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9665: I call them the Id.
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9667: In fact, they’re polite and quiet, which is more than I can say for my colleagues.
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9668: Most Id are shy, but a few are quite curious.
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9669: While I sat taking notes, one came to look at my sketches.
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9670: I offered it my pencil, but that spooked it.
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9671: They remind me of the golems from Kabbalistic texts, or a type of homunculi.
D1_OPCON_ASH_04_ASH_9672: There’s Hercules, Adam, Lillith, Copernicus.

D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9394: As far as occult symbols go, triangles are by no means rare.
D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9395: Northmoor says he looks up at the inverted pyramid.
D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9674: He claims there are more in the House, though I don’t see how he’s so certain.
D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9675: He’s been strange lately, talking about joining “greater causes”, and frequently mentioning a pyramid. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9676: After pressing him he finally described this pyramid to me. Inverted, black, mathematically perfect.
D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9677: Oddly enough, Adam and the other Id have shown me numerous inverted triangles painted on the cave walls.
D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9678: Surely there is a connection, but I don’t see it yet.
D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9680: Fludd, Levi, Krohl, they used that shape like it was going out of fashion. 
D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9681: Standing on their base, triangles signify stability and strength.
D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9682: Inverted, on their points, they represent conflict and stagnation.
D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9683: Of course, the orientation is just a matter of perspective.
D1_OPCON_ASH_05_ASH_9684: Looking at the pyramid from below gives you one, from above, another.

D1_OPCON_ASH_06_ASH_9399: Using the arrays I made, Control Points have been established throughout the Oldest House.
D1_OPCON_ASH_06_ASH_9400: A few months ago, I would have been overjoyed to leave the Foundation, but now I realize I’ve grown fond of it.
D1_OPCON_ASH_06_ASH_9401: I won’t go. I’ll refuse. Northmoor won’t be happy, but so be it.

D1_OPCON_ASH_06_ASH_9687: Two fatalities. Three if you count Mabel.
D1_OPCON_ASH_06_ASH_9688: Northmoor gave the order to transfer our resources on the upper floors,

D1_OPCON_ASH_06_ASH_9690: Did I forget to include that fact in my previous logs? I’ve been so busy.
D1_OPCON_ASH_06_ASH_9692: Excuse me if I don’t sound excited, it’s just...

D1_OPCON_ASH_07_ASH_9696: I no longer need tools to detect the House’s veins, to hear it breathe.
D1_OPCON_ASH_07_ASH_9697: I can feel its blood churning beneath my bare feet.
D1_OPCON_ASH_07_ASH_9698: I have added my own illustrations to the walls, trying to solve some mystery that the Oldest House whispers to me.
D1_OPCON_ASH_07_ASH_9699: I have to avoid the Id as I do so. They hunt me. I don’t blame them. They’re just following the pillar’s orders.
D1_OPCON_ASH_07_ASH_9700: Even poor Adam doesn’t seem to recognize me any more.
D1_OPCON_ASH_07_ASH_9701: Did you know this city used to be a forest?
D1_OPCON_ASH_07_ASH_9702: I wonder if our Oldest House wore a different face back then, or if it was always here,
D1_OPCON_ASH_07_ASH_9703: a 21st century office building since time immemorial?
D1_OPCON_ASH_07_ASH_9704: Can a place know the future? Can it change its skin? Can it wander?

D1_OPCON_ASH_08_ASH_9407: I’ve decided to rejoin the Bureau in the upper levels, to end my long absence spent in the Foundation.
D1_OPCON_ASH_08_ASH_9408: How did I go so long without a purpose? Without devotion?
D1_OPCON_ASH_08_ASH_9409: I realize how grateful I am to Father for setting me on this path.
D1_OPCON_ASH_08_ASH_9707: I should have seen the web earlier, the strands between Northmoor, the pillar, the gun, the Id.
D1_OPCON_ASH_08_ASH_9708: But what hope did we have, thrown into this conflict beyond our comprehension?
D1_OPCON_ASH_08_ASH_9709: Northmoor will be angry at me for disobeying him, that’s just his way.
D1_OPCON_ASH_08_ASH_9710: But I don’t care. I need to remain in the Oldest House, to help however I can.
D1_OPCON_ASH_08_ASH_9711: I doubt I can steer the Bureau back on the right course, but I have to try.

D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_PEGGY_FROM_BILOXI_9423: Uh, okay.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_PEGGY_FROM_BILOXI_9716: They’re supposed to release negative ions. Clear the air.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_PEGGY_FROM_BILOXI_9717: I got one - only four bucks - and I put it in our living room. I thought it would look nice there.

D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_PEGGY_FROM_BILOXI_9720: He says it needs to stay on, no matter what.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_PEGGY_FROM_BILOXI_9721: Last night, I woke up at 3 am. He wasn’t in bed. I found him in the living room, staring at the lamp.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_PEGGY_FROM_BILOXI_9722: He was smiling. His eyes were open, but I thought he might be sleep walking.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_PEGGY_FROM_BILOXI_9723: So I shook him. He just kept smiling at the light.

D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9437: Welcome to another episode of Brian’s Movie Den, with me, the ever-lovable Brian Hennerman. 
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9438: Today I want to talk about a new film I found at Movie Knight, 
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9439: The movie is called “Delivery Disaster”.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9440: We open in medias res.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9441: The dogs keep pace with the mail truck, tearing chunks out of the driver’s legs and arms.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9442: Is this film a commentary on how our 9-5 jobs are killing us,
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9443: There are lots of ways to interpret it, but for now let’s get to the part you’re all waiting for.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9444: I give this film a four out of five, only because the actor frequently broke the fourth wall-
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9445: And a friendly reminder that there will be no new episode next week as I will be visiting my aunt in Delaware for Thanksgiving.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9736: that’s “knight” with a “k”, the mecca for VHS-aficionados in the greater Dallas area.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9737: A mailman drives a truck full of packages down an endless American neighborhood as a pack of rabid dogs chase behind.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9738: Now these dogs are nothing like my mom's- my stepmom’s corgi, Chuck.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9739: These were some real nightmare hellhounds.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9740: Each package he throws out the door is marked by his bloody handprint.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9741: He screams in pain and confusion, and this goes on and on until the movie just abruptly ends.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9742: There aren’t even any credits, which is a pretty bold choice.
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9743: or how hostile the modern world is to outdated concepts like mailmen?
D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9744: Perhaps it’s merely a statement about the futility of purpose, how no task can ever be really done.

D1_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_BRIAN_9749: “Bike Hard” and “Coffee Bullet” are the only others I’ve found, but this little art house studio certainly knows how to push the boundaries of Western cinema.

d1_opcon_doc_ahtivisit_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p align=CENTER><b>RE: A STRANGE ENCOUNTER</b></p>

<p>An odd thing happened today. I was on my way into the lower caves to visit the Id (I was bringing them a teddy bear, to see what they’d do with it) when I came across a stranger. I found his unperturbed composure in this strange place curious, so I engaged him in conversation. He explained himself in an idiosyncratic, foreign manner. I believe he’s one of the Finnish immigrants that have been arriving to the city. It’s odd that the Bureau has already brought sanitation services down here. Cleanliness is next to godliness, I suppose.</p>

<p>His name was difficult to make out, but I found him to be an interesting fellow. He knows a surprising amount about this place and seems to move in it with uncanny ease, which I admit vexes me a bit. I thought I would master the twists and turns of this beast’s belly before some janitor. And yet, he easily slipped away and left me lost in the red caves when I tried to pursue.</p>

<p>I hope to run into him again. He seems to feel right at home here, as I am beginning to. Perhaps next time I’ll introduce him to the Id. I bet they’d like that singing voice of his.</p>

<p>A ceramic “beckoning cat” figurine, common luck object found in Japanese storefronts.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the item(s) observed altered effects: Non-corporeality, affinity for specific human behavior, and minor physical movement (waving its arm).</p>

<p>Multiple simultaneous incarnations of this item have been observed. Whether these are independent Altered Items acting uniformly or replicated instances of AI48 is unknown.</p>

<p>How the item(s) originally arrived in the Oldest House is unknown. It was first discovered sitting in the Director’s chair and was immediately contained in a Panopticon cell. The next day, an agent noticed two additional figurines had appeared. Hours later, all three vanished. The item(s) has been sighted throughout the Bureau, appearing while agents perform <em>REDACTED</em> tasks. It is theorized that fulfilling certain unknown criteria will encourage the item(s) to appear.</p>

<p>The item should be isolated from any person or event that is objectively interesting since its effect is activated by the presence of dramatic incidents.</p>

<p><u>DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:</u></p>

<p>A movie camera used to make commercial feature films. Internal mechanisms are unremarkable.</p>

<p>Subjects near the item will often experience a “torqued” version of reality resembling the heightened drama and action of a movie. Whether these events are localized alternate realities or products of hallucination is currently unknown.</p>

<p>Additionally, the item seems to record footage from these incidents and creates VHS copies, edited in the style of short films.</p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>

<p>During their investigation, agents learned that a podcast titled “Brian’s Movie Den” had reviewed the item-generated movie “Delivery Disaster”. The podcast’s creator, Brian Hennerman, was taken for questioning. The staff of Movie Knight, the store Mr. Hennerman rented the film from, were also questioned to no effect.</p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>

<p>The item first came to the Bureau’s attention after a hospitalized mailman from <em>REDACTED</em>, Arkansas claimed his injuries had been caused by a movie camera. Further investigation connected the incident to AI80, which was being shipped in the mail truck at the time. The packaged camera was later found in an empty warehouse. The return address led agents to a PO Box located in the San Fernando Valley belonging to a company called Blessed Pictures. Whether Blessed Pictures is involved in the creation and dissemination of the item’s VHS films is unknown (see investigation 13-HQ-612).</p>

<p>The following is a list of all known films believed to have been shot by AI80-UE.</p>

<p>- Shoot First, Die Last (unreleased)*</p>

<p>- Coffee Bullet</p>

<p>- Billy’s First Car</p>

<p>- Bike Hard</p>

<p>- Delivery Disaster</p>

<p>*Item was used in the filming of an unreleased western in 1968 on the Italian island of Sardinia. A cast member was killed during an on-set accident, stopping production. It is believed that Blessed Pictures bought the camera when equipment from the shoot was sold at auction.</p>

<p><u>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:</u></p>

<p>Item has proven impossible to fully contain when in proximity of human beings.</p>

<p>Item is to be sent to <em>REDACTEEEED </em> <em>REDACTED</em>  in the <em>REDACTED</em> of the Oldest House in order to prevent any future access.</p>

<p><u>DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:</u></p>

<p>A VHS (Video Home System) tape cassette. Item will not eject from the television player used at the time its altered status became evident.</p>

<p>The VHS plays footage of <em>Ahti</em> (Entity A-001) cleaning a floor and dancing. This footage renders individuals incapable of movement, speech, or thought while the television screen is within view. This effect is estimated to last indefinitely, though the most time spent in this state by a test subject is 21 hours. Individuals only recollect hearing strange music during their entranced state. Footage plays on a constant loop even when the television is not connected to a power source.</p>

<p>Even when the television and its footage are contained within an enclosed cell with no window, agents in proximity have been driven to open and enter the cell by the item’s entrancing nature.</p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>

<p>This item’s creation is the source of much research and debate.</p>

<p>It was a product of the Bureau’s first attempts to film <em>Ahti</em> (Entity A-001) during Operation Shallow Tide. An agent was able to conceal themselves in an area frequented by Ahti, at which point they began filming. The agent reported that the video camera showed no signs of disturbance during the filming.</p>

<p>Later, when reviewing the footage, the research staff became mesmerized by its altered effect. Measures were taken and altered evaluation began.</p>

<p>Never before have Bureau personnel been so closely involved in the creation of an Altered Item. The experiment was quickly replicated, though not with the same results. The footage was simply useless in every subsequent attempt.</p>

<p>This event spawned a great debate as to whether Altered Items are created by paranatural entities, intentionally or otherwise. Similar experiments were prohibited soon after (see the Ash Act for details), as the creation of altered materials was deemed an action the Bureau should not engage in.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>With the Astral Plane now physically accessible, a torrent of new information has been collected on the entities known as Astral Copies.</p>

<p>The Copies’ bodies are composed of a dense stone-like material that is both resilient under controlled circumstances and brittle when struck with significant force (see report 8-11-1633 for full composition analysis). Whether the Astral Copies possess individual consciousness or are directed by a higher intelligence such as the Board remains unknown. However, their shared aggression seems to indicate a unified goal.</p>

<p>Director Faden’s encounters with these entities when binding Objects of Power in the Astral Plane indicate they serve as live targets for potential parautilitarians to practice on. Some have been equipped with Bureau weaponry, though it seems unlikely they were armed by our personnel.</p>

<p>It is important to note that they appear immune to Hiss corruption.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Astral Spikes are metastructural entities found in the Astral Plane. Their existence was first confirmed when a single Spike travelled into our dimension through the mind of an Astralnaut (see report <em>REDACTED</em> for details re: Agent Gibson).</p>

<p>Astral Spikes seem to exist beyond our dimension’s physical laws. They do not resemble any living creature or animate object we have yet encountered. They are even dissimilar to Astral Copies, despite the fact that both originate from the Astral Plane.</p>

<p>The Spikes are immensely dangerous, emitting a wavelength that disrupts all organic and inorganic matter in their immediate vicinity with catastrophic results. Discerning the nature of this wavelength has been difficult for obvious reasons, but the Parakinesiology Department continues to investigate.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Astral Mimics are physically indistinguishable from Astral Copies, but considerably more dangerous due to the fact that they possess parautilitarian abilities. The most notable ability witnessed is levitation.</p>

<p>It is unknown how this Astral entity gained its paranatural abilities. The relevant Objects of Power are currently bound to Director Faden, which indicates the Objects are not responsible. However, Objects of Power are intrinsically linked to the Board and the Astral Plane. A similar link between the Objects and the Mimics could also exist. Or perhaps the Board is able to dispense these abilities at their leisure, with no trial in the Astral Plane required?</p>

<p>The prevailing theory, however, is that the entities are simply replicating observed abilities performed by the Hiss, or even the Director herself, thanks to a prolonged exposure to our world caused by the Astral Bleed.</p>

<p><u>EVENT SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>A series of reverberating sounds observed in downtown Kyiv with no clear point of origin. The event was witnessed by the city’s general public. Mental and physical symptoms were reported, including aphasia, sleep paralysis, and excess <em>[REDACTED]</em> in the reported individuals.</p>

<p><u>EVENT RESPONSE:</u></p>

<p>Due to the brief nature of the event, overseas Bureau agents were not able to respond while it was active. Immediately upon arrival, agents collected audio recordings taken by local witnesses. All Bureau monitoring stations located at global junctions of acoustic amplification were directed to monitor any auditory events of similar pitch, wavelength, and duration in an effort to trace echoes or epicenters. In the following weeks, similar cases were reported from both various amateur sources and Bureau stations in major cities across the globe. The subsequent events diminished in volume and frequency per each occurrence.</p>

<p>Event is believed to be generated by planar friction, though this is not confirmed (see file 71-849-062 for full hypothesis).</p>

<p><u>DETAILS:</u></p>

<p>Recordings of the audio phenomena were uploaded onto the internet shortly after the event. These records circulated rapidly on popular message boards. The Communications Department utilized this exposure by creating “Sky Trumpet hoax” videos and posting related theories to spread confusion and draw attention away from the event’s paranatural origin. Industrial noise, particularly the sound of metal drilling was found to be a widely-accepted explanation. Theories about the sounds emanating from the Earth itself, known as Seismic Hum, emerged from the public itself and were encouraged by the Bureau to generate further misdirection and eventual public disinterest.</p>

<p>Witnesses of the event were monitored discretely afterwards. Observed symptoms were consistent with <em>[REDACTED]</em> deprivation, but subsided after 12-15 days. The length of the symptoms directly correlated to the individual’s proximity (unsheltered) to the supposed epicenter. One linked, although accidental, casualty can be listed (see report re: the effects of planar friction on hearing aids in file 14-200-1010).</p>

<p><u>EVENT SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>This Paradimensional Occurrence consisted of three sequential sinkholes induced by subterranean implosions revealing foreign material of magmatic qualities.</p>

<p><u>EVENT RESPONSE:</u></p>

<p>A local chapter of the Youth Science League were participating in an archeological dig on the hill when the event occurred. Many boys were injured in the resulting collapse. Some touched the magma directly.</p>

<p>Bureau agents arrived at the scene seven days after the incident. Samples of the lava-like material were taken. The area was quickly sealed off from the public at our recommendation. Our aim was to ensure all remnants of the material were rendered inoffensive but the magma descended too deeply into the earth to retrieve. Foul-smelling odors were detected in the area, which were hypothesized being the dissipated element’s vapor trail left at the scene.</p>

<p>All acquired material was delivered to Washington for examination in the Bureau’s onsite laboratories.</p>

<p><u>DETAILS:</u></p>

<p>The retrieved material was subjected to Felstrom’s Array, configuration 74-B, but the tests were halted as the matter began to physically elude the equipment. Attempts to constrain the element were made but, under further stress, it became vaporous. The researchers suffered corrosive injuries prior to their deaths.</p>

<p>The child victims at Meteor Hill recounted the material enveloping them in a pleasant manner upon making contact but when discovered, they were <em>[REDACTED]</em> and screaming. Bodily changes were perceived immediately (deformities, loss of pigment in the skin and hair) and mental symptoms surfaced in subsequent examinations (confusion, heightened aggression).</p>

<p>The Department of Public Knowledge and Diversions gave statements claiming the incident was caused by debris from poorly-made Russian satellites, which the public accepted with no complications.</p>

<p>The children were sent to the Bureau’s recuperation facility in <em>REDACTED</em> to receive help, away from society.</p>

<p>For all my research into the Oldest House’s leylines, I still don’t understand why they converge here, at the base of this pillar. I suppose the simplest reason is that they have to converge somewhere. Occam’s Razor and all that. But that seems wrong. The esoteric world abhors coincidence.</p>

<p>So what is the true relationship between this pillar and the leylines? Does it act as a magnet, attracting them? Polar North? Or is the pillar a product of their focused energies? A sprout, nourished by the constant flow of the Oldest House’s power?</p>

<p>Perhaps classifying that power would provide some insight. However, we currently have no means of measuring or quantifying it. Given time, it may become possible to collect and even harness this energy.</p>

<p>On that note, Northmoor is bringing in the much-lauded Dr. Gustav Wagner from headquarters in D.C. to “aid my research”. I suppose this is his way of saying he doesn’t trust me to work unsupervised. Let’s just hope Dr. Wagner is as smart as his dearly departed Führer once believed him to be.</p>

<p>My husband, Francis, read an article before he died about how the universe was really just a computer program. He believed it. I thought it sounded silly, but now I think he was right.</p>

<p>Francis was hit by a car a few months ago. A drunk driver. I don’t think it was supposed to happen.</p>

<p>My neighbor’s son, Jeremy, broke one of our windows with a football a week before Francis died. Francis yelled at Jeremy for it. He was a bit harsh.</p>

<p>This is important because I see Jeremy on his computer through their living room window. He’s on it all the time. His mother says he is a computer whiz. I think Jeremy is operating the computer program and he changed the universe so that driver would hit Francis. He did it to get back at Francis for yelling at him.</p>

<p>Is there a way to change the computer and make Francis come back? I have some money if it’s expensive. I don’t know how these things work. I don’t care if Jeremy gets in trouble or not. I just want Francis to come home.</p>

d1_opcon_doc_etchings_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p align=CENTER><b>ON THE FOUR ETCHINGS</b></p>

<p>My explorations of the Foundation have resulted in yet another mystery: a fascinating series of etchings on large stone tablets.</p>

<p>The tablets themselves are likely not native to the Foundation, seeing as they’re slabs of sedimentary stone, quite different from the cave’s categorization-defying rock. Their placement and form are also too intentional to be naturally occurring. But who braved this place to carry them in? And for what purpose? I discovered a five-point macro-entanglement between the tablets, with the pillar at its center. These links seem to extend beyond our level of consciousness, to some astral realm I can’t detect. Is Northmoor’s Board somehow tied to all this?</p>

<p>The etchings on these tablets are similarly curious. They differ from the cave paintings in style and technique, so are clearly not of the same origin. Are they the visual narration of some event? Or do they indicate intent, a wish, a plan? They only seem to consist of a tree and the pillar, but the sizes of either are inconsistent. What does that signify?</p>

<p>I’m missing key pieces of this puzzle and it’s unlikely I’ll ever find them.</p>

<p>An item resembling a fondue set was sent to America Overnight’s (a.k.a. FBC Initiative #72-A) offsite studio accompanied by a threatening letter and cremated human remains. Long-time show producer Karen Harris was killed when she <em>placed</em> her <em>hand</em> into the item. Mr. <em>REDACTED</em>, the program’s host, was able to contain the item by <em>REDACTEDED</em> it.</p> 

<p><u>ACTION TAKEN:</u></p>

<p>The fondue set is undergoing evaluation at the FBC satellite facility in <em>DACTED</em>.</p>

<p>The package was traced back to a PO Box belonging to the Blessed Pictures production company. This same company was involved in the discovery of AI80.</p>

<p>According to Post Office records, Blessed’s PO Box was opened in 1968 and paid through December 2029. Employees cannot recall anyone ever collecting mail from the PO Box.</p>

<p>Case 13-HQ-612 has been reopened. Attempts to locate the physical address or staff of Blessed Pictures are ongoing.</p>

<p><u>ADDENDUM:</u></p>

<p>It should be noted that during debriefing, Mr. <em>REDACTED</em> revealed he was in a romantic relationship with Ms. Harris. He has since been placed on mandatory leave of absence for violating Bureau guidelines.</p>

<p>If we do accept that the Hiss Sharpened’s ability is not connected to a known Object of Power, then the Hiss are either manifesting unique paranatural abilities or there are Objects in the House that we aren’t aware of.

d1_opcon_doc_housetheory_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p align=CENTER><b>ON THE HISTORY OF THE OLDEST HOUSE</b></p>

<p>The Oldest House has revealed much to me during my months in the Foundation, but many questions remain. Primarily, the tree etchings bewilder me. What is their significance? If the House has changed shape over its lifetime as I’ve theorized, then was a tree its first form?</p>

<p>I sent a team to the Schwarzman Building in search of pre-settlement accounts of Manhattan Island. From those, I discovered a single relevant line: “And there I found a tree not known to me. The Devil twisted within its bark.” That line, taken with the fact that certain American cultures believed some trees would offer wisdom and guidance, is indeed interesting. However, it’s hardly firm evidence. And though I am now bound to the Oldest House, I remain a man of science.</p>

<p>Of course, there are numerous ancient beliefs regarding trees. Yggdrasil, the Tree of Knowledge, yaax imix che. Some cultures offered blood sacrifices to trees, while others claimed trees endowed chosen individuals with inhuman powers. Do New York City’s many murders act as sacrifice for the Oldest House? Does the House have a chosen champion?</p>

<p>Is it me?</p>

d1_opcon_doc_nailtheory_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p align=CENTER><b>ON THE NATURE OF THE PILLAR</b></p>

<p>The pillar found in the Crossroads is best described as an onyx spike that protrudes from the cave floor like an imposing stalagmite. Despite its aggressive silhouette, the structure has an undeniable allure. Freud would certainly have something to say about the pillar’s overly “erect” nature, but I’m more drawn to Witmoore’s essay on dynamic layers, structures within structures, the fractal mirror in every being. Given its significant location, I believe the pillar is either the very heart of the Oldest House or an intrusion within that heart.</p>

<p>Or perhaps it’s like the husk of a seed, from which the Oldest House sprouted. Trottier wrote that great architecture isn’t built; it grows. But then why does the pillar look so different from the rest of this place’s concrete walls and rocky caverns? It’s easier to see it as an anomaly, a buried artifact, a foreign body, a demonic phallus.</p>

<p>I wonder if this pillar is any more welcome here than we are.</p>

<p>Frank,</p>

<p>I have reviewed your report of my latest medical. I was disappointed to see that you believe my connection to the Service Weapon and the Board are “products of delusion brought on by the stresses of leadership.”</p>

<p>You witnessed my feats firsthand. You yourself declared my body temperature “impossible”. These are no delusions, they are the product of divine collaboration. The Board has awoken in me a power beyond your understanding and that power will only continue to grow. Your job is to merely ensure that I survive my gift, and with absolute discretion.</p>

<p>To that end, my gifts are best used with a degree of mystery that your needles and probes betray. No further medicals shall be required.</p>

<p>I forbid you to speak of this matter with your colleagues, especially Dr. Ash. Under no circumstances do I want him involved. Keep your mouth shut and keep me alive. The Board knows what I have become, and theirs is the only opinion that counts.</p>

d1_opcon_doc_powercore_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p align=CENTER><b>ON THE INVENTION OF THE POWER CORE</b></p>

<p>After numerous attempts, I’ve finally found a way to intercept and contain the ambient energy of the leylines in a kind of non-Aristotelian battery I’ve dubbed the “Power Core”. I admit it was difficult capturing an energy I can barely measure, much less interact with. Luckily, it seems that the porous stone of the Foundation’s caverns possesses such conductive qualities. Using stone flakes and copper wire, my Power Cores collect significant power. My early prototypes collected too much, in fact, but I’ve since reinforced the container.</p>

<p>We don’t yet know the repercussions of tapping into this power field. As a precaution, these devices should not be taken outside of the House. Ideally, the Bureau should no longer need to rely on typical energy sources. It’s my greatest feat of engineering yet.</p>

<p>I’ve always had an interest in invention. I like the creativity that it allowed, set within the firm boundaries of logic and physics. Father never approved, calling it a “mundane” science. With that in mind, I dedicate this invention to Theodore Ash Senior. May he scowl in peace!</p>

d1_opcon_doc_pyramidtheory_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p align=CENTER><b>ON THE PYRAMID AND GEOMETRY</b></p>

<p>I’ve been going through my library, researching pyramids and triangles. If that shape does relate to the Board as Northmoor says, then perhaps our predecessors in the occult can offer some insight through their geometric knowledge.</p>

<p>In esotericism, the triangle is closely associated with the Holy Trinity and other three-part concepts. Past, present, future. Mind, body, spirit. Interestingly, the term “Board” also implies multiple parts.</p>

<p>Upright triangles in Judeo-Christian imagery indicate ascent into the rational/divine realm. Inverted, it signifies a descent into the corporeal/human. Naturally, the ascent is masculine and the fall is feminine. Adam and Eve. That’s just a bit of old-world patriarchy. It’s 1964 now and we’re well past that silliness.</p>

<p>Considering the above, what does the inverted triangle tell us about the Board? They’re clearly not corporeal or human. Perhaps they wish to be? Or they once were? The likeliest answer is simply that theological imagery cannot help us define alien entities.</p>

<p>But still, the pyramid seems significant. Shapes have power and clearly so does the Board.</p>

<p>You missed the good news! I’m sure the official memo will go out soon, but Northmoor called an all-hands at the Crossroads to announce we’re finally moving out of this hellhole and up into the House proper. Bureau brass apparently solved the moving walls problem... or at least figured out a way to pinpoint where and when they happen.</p>

<p>All I know is going up means goodbye darkness, goodbye weird lunches with that ex-Nazi scientist, and goodbye pissing into the pit (I know that was you, Barry).</p>

<p>Northmoor’s ordering the Foundation sealed as soon as we can haul our stuff out and somehow convince Ash to come with us. He’s the only one kicking up a fuss.</p>

<p>This is long overdue. We’ve lost eleven men and damn near ten thousand dollars in supplies moving between the entrance and the Foundation. And for what? Research? Ash is batty if he thinks we want to stay here and sift through more sand for him. It’s just rusted iron flakes anyway. Did you know that? We were breathing that shit in!</p>

<p>I am Containment Processes Designer Jeanne Gibbs and I’m writing this to document the largest Building Shift to ever occur.</p>

<p>Here are the facts: a considerably large section of the Containment Sector, including the Processes and Protocols offices, our research facilities, and a fair chunk of the Firebreak has been yanked down to a chasm that reaches far below lobby level (I think?). It was a violent Shift, and I regret to report several casualties. Injuries were sustained by all, but many of us, myself included, are still mobile. We’ve set up a base camp and started triaging. There are little supplies.</p>

<p>We explored our surroundings and found caverns of all things. Maybe we’re in some kind of cave Threshold, like the Quarry? Wherever we are, we’re not the first. There were some rusty power cores, old lights, signs – infrastructure.</p>

<p>What was this area used for? Why did they seal it off? Why have we never heard of it?</p>

<p>More importantly, how are we going to get out?</p>

<p>Gibbs, reporting in. It has been eight days since the collapse and still no sign of any rescue efforts. The Bureau is either completely unaware of our situation or are incapable of helping us. Or maybe it’s intentional. How many times have we seen the Bureau not give two shits about its own hardworking staff when they go missing in this place? How many times did we let it slide, thinking “Oh, at least it wasn’t me”?</p>

<p>Too many, I’m ashamed to admit.</p>

<p>Anyway, there have been some developments. Strange crystals have begun growing through the walls. They seem to block some corridors, but not others. The path to the caves is always left open, but we’re not sure why. Luckily, the crystals keep out the Astral Spike. One’s been hounding us for days.</p>

<p>John, Nicolay, and Sarah went to try and find a radio, but never came back. We think the Spike got them. I think it’s hunting us. Doug says Spikes only exist in the Astral Plane, so what the fuck is it doing here?</p>

<p>It’s clear no one is coming. We’re running out of ideas and supplies. We tried going into the caves to find anything edible, but all we found were noxious gases and endless pits. The crystals only let us go one way, even though we could see the caves branched out. We did find some weird spikey pillar. I only got a glimpse of it before the Astral Spikes attacked. There were a few of them this time. We lost a lot of people. There’s only six of us left.</p>

<p>We didn’t ask for this. We didn’t want to come down here. I’m convinced something brought us here. The others say I’m going nuts, but it’s clear that this was no House Shift. Shifts slide a bathroom a sector over, or rotate a hallway, they don’t drop full divisions into some caves. We were brought here. I know it.</p>

<p>But for what? Why tear us away from our lives just to torture us? If this is some sort of test or mission, then here’s some advice for whoever’s running it: give out clearer instructions next time.</p>

<p>At first I thought the cave paintings in the Foundation chronicled ancient humans’ encounters with natural occurrences like weather, but it soon became clear they depicted events far outside the average human experience.</p>

<p>Also, it seems I was wrong to assume the images are ancient. Radiocarbon dating suggests something impossible: that I’ve been down here longer than the paintings. That’s absurd though. The style and medium clearly indicate a Paleolithic origin.</p>

<p>I was ready to conclude that an ancient community of humans lived in or around the Oldest House. Now, with this information, I don’t know what to think. Is one of our agents drawing these? Or is there someone down here with us?</p>

<p>This place has a habit of skewing my results, so perhaps the data is corrupted. Or perhaps some paintings were created at different times. The art does seem to chronicle not only the past, but also the present and possibly even the future. I see in them echoes of the Board, some linear architecture, even what could be interpreted as a director.</p>

<p>Are the paintings telling a story that’s still being written? If so, who is writing it?</p>

D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9185: [0.63-1.35]Of course.[1.78-3.58]I’ve been busy with surface analysis.[3.62-10.48]Its composition is remarkably similar to that of material found in the Astral Plane, but it alters itself between my observations.[10.85-13.32]It’s almost as if it doesn’t like being examined.
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9187: [0.75-2.51]Not necessarily.[2.83-5.98]If we assume that, we’re suddenly facing a lot of new questions.
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9189: [0.25-0.75]Hmm.[1.38-2.12]Doubtful.
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9191: [0.60-1.75]As if I could resist.[2.02-4.14]The biggest question is where it comes from.[4.29-5.12]A Threshold?[5.21-6.87]Or is it native to the Foundation?[7.07-9.76]If so, why doesn’t it grow in the rest of the Oldest House?
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9192: Have you learned anything about the crystals?
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9194: Huh.
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9197: That information is on a need-to-know basis, Faden.
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9198: [0.66-2.46]Sorry, couldn’t resist.[2.94-5.25]Honestly, I never had much interaction with Marshall.[5.31-7.38]She only came to me when she was looking for Darling.
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9200: [0.00-1.84]But this is Helen Marshall we’re talking about.[1.95-4.50]The woman who singlehandedly dealt with the Bergen Peak AWE.[4.50-7.96]If she’s down here, it’s because she needs to be.
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9203: [0.50-1.04]Good luck.[1.44-2.28]Take notes!
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9593: [0.24-2.77]How did something so large get out of the Astral Plane?[2.95-5.01]And how did it get inside the Oldest House?
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9594: [0.04-1.33]Did a Threshold bring it in?[1.39-2.14]Did people?[2.45-3.69]Maybe through the Motel?
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9595: The fact that they return to an earlier state when damaged is severely inconsistent with our reality’s adherence to linear time. 
D1_OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_9596: [0.14-8.35]So either they’re A) partially conscious or B) organic elements that are foreign to, and yet influenced by, our dimension.[8.88-9.88]The jury is still out.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9205: Has the Nail been doing anything since we restored it?
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9207: Anything unusual.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9209: Emily.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9211: [0.45-2.43]Wait...[2.43-4.57]was the field created when I cleansed the Nail?
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9213: I’ve been wondering about that myself. 
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9214: [0.00-2.40]Did the Board let the Hiss corrupt the Nail?[2.79-4.17]Did they want me to cleanse it?[4.67-6.45]If so, why?
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9215: What do you know about Director Northmoor?
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9217: I think the word you’re looking for is “bureaucratic”.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9221: [0.38-1.11]Don’t worry.[1.92-3.83]If anyone’s getting shown the door, it’s them.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9227: What do you know about an entity named Former?
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9229: [0.51-4.05]Well, imagine a one-eyed bug thing.[4.99-9.64]I think it was a part of the Board, but then something happened and now it’s...[11.01-11.75]separate?
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9231: [0.48-1.88]Fortune favors the prepared.[3.29-3.63]Do it.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9232: I’m gonna keep looking around.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_9234: We’ll work on that.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_OPTION1: Nail Field
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_OPTION2: Northmoor
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_OPTION3: Former
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_OPTION4: End Conversation
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9206: Define “anything”.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9208: Define “unus-
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9210: [0.51-0.97]Sorry.[1.41-3.46]But the answer is a whopping YES.[3.76-6.59]Now that it’s whole, the Nail is emitting a constant field of...[6.96-9.77]well, think of it like low-level radiation.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9212: [0.29-1.40]I considered that.[1.40-5.17]But the Nail’s readings are quite different from the ones I recorded at the cleansed Control Points.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9216: [0.51-2.76]Well, he was Director Trench’s predecessor.[2.90-6.65]And Northmoor’s famous for being the first Board-appointed Director.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9218: [0.46-1.53]Or antiquated.[1.96-4.77]Regardless, Northmoor was eventually forced to...[5.69-7.67]well, we don’t need to go into that.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9219: [0.38-3.21]If the Board appoints a Director, then how do they retire them?[3.77-5.47]I doubt they go out and buy you a gold watch.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9220: Sorry, Jesse, I didn’t mean to imply-
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9228: [0.28-1.67]I can’t say I’ve heard of it.[2.11-3.43]You got any details for me?
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9230: [0.31-1.06]Interesting.[1.47-8.56]See, I always wondered if the Board was some sort of entity or a group or conglomerate of linked consciousnesses, but this supports the group theory.[9.17-12.23]Although it could have undergone some sort of corporeal exile.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9233: I wish I could go with you, but I still need thirty hours of training before I can do field work.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9597: [0.12-3.21]It seems to suppress any biological matter it encounters.[3.56-7.19]This explains why nothing grows here, and why the Bureau had to abandon the area.[7.85-10.76]Prolonged exposure would certainly begin affecting neural processes.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9598: I think the Nail’s field is purely of its own making.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9599: In fact, I think it would passively prevent any Hiss corruption, like the HRAs do, which makes me wonder what actually occurred when you cleansed the Nail.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9600: [0.67-6.92]Before we found the Oldest House, Directors were picked by committees of old men in suits drinking cognac and smoking cigars or whatever.[7.28-9.23]You know, standard uninteresting methods.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9601: [0.44-4.25]Strangely, the only two Board-appointed Directors left the position under...[4.61-7.06]unusual circumstances.
D1_OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_9602: [0.08-2.64]Too many unknowns to form a working hypothesis yet.[2.64-6.35]But I can prioritize this matter in future Astral dives if you think it’s important.
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9153: [0.50-4.06]The Rangers have tapped into an old radio network they found around the Foundation.[4.41-6.99]So if you need back-up just call them at one of the stations.
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9154: [0.14-5.45]The Rangers found a section of the Containment Sector in the caves, but no House shifts occur down here.[6.35-7.04]Strange.
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9155: [0.25-2.10]The Nail is almost repaired.[2.91-5.05]You really do have a knack for this kind of work.
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9156: [0.44-3.25]If you’re not going to listen to me then you better go figure out how to stop this.[4.30-6.84]There’s no telling what could happen if the vibrations escalate.
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9157: [0.41-2.95]Please figure out how to stop these tremors, Jesse.[3.61-5.43]The Bureau won’t survive if they escalate.
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9158: Now that this Nail business is handled, I should probably be getting back to Executive.
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9159: [0.64-1.06]But..[1.50-3.95]maybe I’ll keep poking around.[4.52-5.45]Just for a little bit.
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9160: [0.19-3.45]Crystals, cave paintings, rust-filled sand.[4.10-6.08]This place is a research goldmine!
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9161: [0.52-2.90]I knew I should have brought my carbon-dating equipment.[3.47-5.32]It’s one of those things you always take for granted.
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9162: Hello!
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9163: Good to see you again.
D1_OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_9164: Anything I can help with?

D1M01_01_JESSE_8883: [0.41-2.05]A problem in the Foundation...[3.39-5.34]That was Ahti’s vacation spot.[6.43-7.56]We need to check this out.
D1M01_02_JESSE_8884: [0.00-5.04]Dark, quiet, transdimensional...[6.45-8.79]This place really suits Ahti.
D1M01_02_JESSE_8885: [0.11-1.20]No time for sightseeing.[2.01-4.36]The Board said this was an emergency.
D1M01_02_JESSE_8886: [0.35-2.73]So that etching is the “door”?[4.25-6.55]OK, let’s try opening it.
D1M01_03_JESSE_8887: Looks like no one’s been down here in awhile.
D1M01_03_JESSE_8888: [0.27-0.76]Huh.[1.92-3.38]Those crystals are kind of pretty.[4.90-7.27]Emily would be having a field day down here.
D1M01_03_JESSE_8889: [0.28-2.11]Those paintings look old.[3.29-6.12]Like, old old.
D1M01_03_JESSE_8890: [0.08-1.85]Who made the art down here?[3.47-5.85]Doesn’t look very Bureau approved.
D1M01_03_JESSE_8891: So the Hiss found their way down here too, huh.
D1M01_03_JESSE_8892: [0.38-1.70]The Hiss are here too.[2.18-3.16]That can’t be good.
D1M01_03_JESSE_8893: What’s that light?
D1M01_03_JESSE_8894: [0.08-1.94]That light looks kind of...[2.74-3.74]familiar?
D1M01_03_JESSE_8895: That crack doesn’t look good.
D1M01_03_JESSE_8896: [0.00-1.15]Those structures.[1.72-2.41]Is that...[2.77-4.49]the Astral Plane?[5.13-7.09]How is that possible?
D1M01_03_JESSE_8897: [0.07-1.38]This is worse than I thought.[1.74-3.31]I need to figure out what’s going on.
D1M01_03_JESSE_8898: The Hiss are using pickaxes now?
D1M01_03_JESSE_8899: [0.03-1.70]So the Hiss are still changing huh?[2.01-3.29]Must be running out of ammo.
D1M01_03_JESSE_8900: [0.06-2.76]The Astral Plane is cutting into our dimension.[3.54-5.23]What if this happens in the upper floors?[6.06-7.27]It’ll destroy the Bureau.
D1M01_03_JESSE_8901: [0.13-1.76]I wish I’d brought Emily with me.[1.97-5.24]I could really use my Head of Research right about now.
D1M01_04_JESSE_8905: [0.06-0.78]Marshall?[1.22-2.80]How is she on the Hotline?[3.49-4.08]Unless...[5.14-6.06]she’s dead?
D1M01_04_JESSE_8906: [0.66-1.38]Jesus.[1.99-4.58]She seemed like the kind of woman who could survive anything.
D1M01_05_JESSE_8907: Marshall?
D1M01_05_JESSE_8908: [0.38-1.00]Marshall![1.73-2.76]You’re alive!
D1M01_05_JESSE_8909: [0.22-0.87]Wait![1.09-1.94]It’s Jesse!
D1M01_05_JESSE_8910: The Director!
D1M01_06_JESSE_8911: [0.00-0.90]Whoa.[1.55-3.24]This place is huge.
D1M01_06_JESSE_8912: Look at that...
D1M01_06_JESSE_8913: [0.29-1.12]Marshall?[2.10-2.82]Can you hear me?
D1M01_06_JESSE_8914: She was on the Hotline, so that person couldn’t have been Marshall, right? 
D1M01_06_JESSE_8915: [0.00-1.03]One problem at a time.[1.63-3.55]Let’s see what’s going on with that pillar first.
D1M01_06_JESSE_8916: Let’s see what’s going on with that glowing pillar first.
D1M01_06_JESSE_8917: Let’s see what’s going on with that broken pillar first.
D1M01_06_JESSE_8918: Let’s see what’s going on with that piece of modern art first.
D1M01_06_JESSE_8919: How old is this equipment?
D1M01_07_BOARD_8920: < Nail/Door/Monolith is hurt >
D1M01_07_BOARD_8921: < Touch/Revere it to enter >
D1M01_08_BOARD_8927: < Left/Self or Right/Weapon >
D1M01_08_BOARD_8928: < Only one is permitted >
D1M01_08_BOARD_8929: < Which will you choose/become? >
D1M01_08_BOARD_8931: < Left/Self will grant Shape/Manipulate >
D1M01_08_BOARD_8932: < Right/Weapon will grant Fracture/Undo >
D1M01_08_BOARD_8933: < Time to choose/decide/haven’t got all day >
D1M01_08_JESSE_8930: [0.08-2.31]So I can only choose one?[3.08-4.97]I thought I was done with these tests.
D1M01_10_BOARD_8936: < Use the new Upgrade/Self to Shape/Inflate >
D1M01_10_BOARD_8938: < Minerals/Roots/Barnacles grow across the Foundation >
D1M01_10_BOARD_8939: < Use the new Ammo/Casing to Demolish/Weed-whack >
D1M01_10_BOARD_8940: < First Director to receive/earn this >
D1M01_10_BOARD_8941: < You should feel Honored/Handled >
D1M01_10_BOARD_8942: < Dismantle/Loosen the four Locks/Keys/McGuffins >
D1M01_10_BOARD_8943: < Located in the Fringe/Nowhere of the Astral Plane >
D1M01_10_BOARD_8944: < Astral Bleeding/Collision has spread/lost them > 
D1M01_10_BOARD_8945: < Do this and Nail will be repaired/glued/crisis averted >
D1M01_10_BOARD_8946: < P.S./Bonus Round: Hiss are present in Foundation >
D1M01_10_BOARD_8947: < Trespassing/Snooping is forbidden >
D1M01_11_JESSE_8948: [0.00-1.80]OK, let’s review.[2.73-6.29]This broken pillar is called the Nail.[6.69-8.01]It was broken by...[8.67-13.15]something and now the Astral Plane is bleeding into the Foundation, [13.17-19.34] which will destroy the Oldest House, the Bureau, and everyone inside.[20.30-26.27]I need to find four locks or keys or whatever to stop that from happening.
D1M01_11_JESSE_8949: [0.00-1.02]But I’m the Director.[1.46-2.48]I’ve handled worse.[3.61-5.28]This should be simple...[6.22-6.81]ish.
D1M01_11_JESSE_8950: You with me?
D1M02_01_JESSE_8951: Now I can get past those crystals I saw on the way in.
D1M02_01_JESSE_8952: Now I can destroy those crystals I saw on the way in.
D1M02_02_JESSE_8957: [0.47-1.58]I’m here, aren’t I?[2.88-5.25]I saved the Bureau once and I’ll do it again.
D1M02_03_JESSE_8958: Another etching, like the one I used to get in here.
D1M02_04_BOARD_8962: < Well Done/Seasoned! Only three Keys/Tethers remain >
D1M02_04_BOARD_8963: < Our Nail is Rebuilding/Loosening >
D1M02_04_JESSE_8960: Is this the lock slash key the Board told me about?
D1M02_04_JESSE_8961: [0.03-2.71]That must be the lock slash key.[3.06-5.06]But how do we dismantle it?
D1M02_04_JESSE_8964: Just doing my job.
D1M02_05_JESSE_8965: [0.00-1.10]First one down.[1.40-3.52]Director Faden’s got this covered.
D1M02_07_JESSE_8967: [0.00-0.57]Emily.[0.85-2.10]How did she get down here?
D1M02_07_JESSE_8968: What are you doing down here, Emily?
D1M02_07_JESSE_8970: I’m pretty sure I didn’t.
D1M02_07_JESSE_8973: She takes everything in stride.
D1M02_07_JESSE_8974: [0.55-2.83]The Board called me down here to deal with a situation.[3.21-4.33]The Astral Plane is-
D1M02_07_JESSE_8977: [0.54-1.67]That’s what I’m here to stop.[2.33-6.84]The Board told me to fix the Nail over there by dismantling four “locks” in the Astral Plane.
D1M02_07_JESSE_8978: Funny, I think it’s put itself back together a bit.
D1M02_07_JESSE_8983: I’d put money on it. 
D1M02_07_JESSE_8984: [0.42-3.20]That reminds me, have you seen Marshall?[4.13-8.96]She contacted me over the Hotline, but then I saw her walking around.
D1M02_07_JESSE_8986: That’s exactly what I thought.
D1M02_07_JESSE_8989: [0.59-2.21]I think we’re on a clock here, Emily.[2.87-5.66]I need to stop the Astral Bleeding before it brings the Oldest House down.[6.95-9.40]See what you can find out from the Nail in the meantime.
D1M02_07_JESSE_9579: [0.45-3.29]And send out some Rangers to look for Marshall.[4.68-5.85]She may be in trouble.
D1M02_07_POPE_8966: [0.40-0.95]Jesse![0.95-1.38]Hey!
D1M02_07_POPE_8969: [0.39-2.53]What do you mean? You called me down, remember?
D1M02_07_POPE_8971: [0.33-1.84]No, that’s right. You didn’t.[2.25-4.64]But then... I remember you needing me to come here.[5.16-6.40]You even told me how to get in.
D1M02_07_POPE_8972: Let’s just chalk it up to synchronicity so we can get to work.
D1M02_07_POPE_8975: [0.49-3.17]Colliding with our world. I know! Isn’t it fascinating?[3.61-9.05]I never even considered that the Astral Plane could be a physical volume expanding beyond its dimensional container.
D1M02_07_POPE_8976: Given time it will consume the entire Bureau, and possibly beyond.
D1M02_07_POPE_8979: [0.27-2.66]That could be due to the Law of Inverse Exchange.[2.98-7.44]For every associated component you remove, this “Nail” reconstructs.
D1M02_07_POPE_8980: Or possibly some variation of anti-sympathy.
D1M02_07_POPE_8981: Don’t worry, I’ll look into it.
D1M02_07_POPE_8982: [0.45-2.73]Did you notice all the Bureau infrastructure?[3.31-6.56]It looks like there was a research team stationed down here at some point.[7.49-8.96]Do you think Darling knew about this?
D1M02_07_POPE_8985: [1.10-2.48]I haven’t seen her.[3.05-5.57]The Hotline only connects to extraplanar entities.[6.38-7.62]Or dead people.[8.12-11.12]But Marshall’s proved time and time again that she’s a survivor.
D1M02_07_POPE_8987: [0.47-0.75]Anyway![0.78-3.20]I’ve been looking into the minerals growing down here.
D1M02_07_POPE_8988: [0.22-3.17]Have you noticed how they insist on maintaining a certain form?[3.70-8.18]Maybe some sort of state-memory or they consciously prefer a certain shape-
D1M02_07_POPE_8990: [0.54-1.57]Will do, Jesse.[2.25-5.64]If you see anything interesting, remember to take detailed notes!
D1M02_07_POPE_9603: The bleed is localized to this area, but its growth rate seems steady.
D1M02_08_JESSE_8995: [0.04-2.22]So I can’t let the Hiss take the Nail.[2.76-3.48]Not a problem.[3.98-5.12]I know how to handle them.
D1M02_09_JESSE_8996: Another etching.
D1M02_10_BOARD_8998: < Progress/Jolly Good, but two Holes/Lollipops are left to-
D1M02_10_JESSE_8999: [0.37-0.90]Hello?[2.30-2.78]Board?[2.78-3.31]Are you there?
D1M02_11_BOARD_9005: < You should/can/better not be here, Director >
D1M02_11_BOARD_9007: < Former/It/Adrift is trying to mislead you >
D1M02_11_BOARD_9012: < The other Tool/Weapon is forbidden >
D1M02_11_JESSE_9003: OK, what the hell is going on?
D1M02_11_JESSE_9004: [0.42-0.97]Wait.[1.04-1.98]I’m back here?
D1M02_11_JESSE_9006: [0.35-1.47]Wasn’t my idea.[1.84-2.72]Blame the eyeball.
D1M02_11_JESSE_9008: [0.35-0.95]Former?[1.42-2.23]You mean the eyeball?[2.23-4.07]I don’t even know what that is.
D1M02_11_JESSE_9009: [0.30-0.95]Former?[2.54-4.43]Yeah we’ve had our differences.
D1M02_11_JESSE_9010: But it is giving me something you won’t.
D1M02_11_JESSE_9580: But it is giving me something you won't.

D1M02_13_FORMER_9023: < Welcome #@$% Speak? >
D1M02_13_JESSE_9018: I’m getting pretty tired of being jerked around the Astral Plane.
D1M02_13_JESSE_9019: If you’re listening, I want some answers!
D1M02_14_FORMER_9025: < Void @#$@$# Nothing @#$@ Egress >

D1M02_14_JESSE_9024: [0.49-2.05]Uh, hi there.[2.66-5.72]It was nice of you to give me something the Board wouldn’t.[7.32-8.63]What are you getting out of it?
D1M02_14_JESSE_9026: So I’m just supposed to believe you’re a particularly charitable, uh, whatever you are?
D1M02_14_JESSE_9028: [0.26-0.81]Hungry?[1.89-4.72]I mean yeah, actually, I’d love a sandwich or something.
D1M02_14_JESSE_9029: That’s not what you meant, was it?
D1M02_14_JESSE_9031: [0.33-1.40]Are you part of the Board?[2.22-2.89]Or used to be?
D1M02_14_JESSE_9033: OK, so you split because the Board blamed you for...?
D1M02_14_JESSE_9035: God, it’d be easier to play charades.
D1M02_14_JESSE_9037: I don’t know what I expected.
D1M02_14_JESSE_9038: [0.40-4.71]Listen, this has been great, but I have to go.[6.13-10.84]Thanks for your help and, uh, stay out of trouble.
D1M02_14_JESSE_9581: Do I need to rescue someone?

D1M02_16_JESSE_9042: [0.15-3.09]What was Former trying to tell me about the Board?[3.84-5.38]Should I trust either of them?
D1M02_16_JESSE_9043: [0.00-2.03]Former is probably just trying to use me.[2.82-5.32]But should I really trust the Board?
D1M02_18_JESSE_9044: [0.42-1.93]Who should I be listening to?[2.73-4.82]Weird entity A or B?[5.42-6.05]Or neither?
D1M02_18_JESSE_9045: [0.03-1.57]Let’s just stay the course for now.[1.88-3.35]The Bureau’s in danger.[3.94-5.94]We know we need to repair the Nail.
D1M02_18_JESSE_9046: The Astral Plane won’t break reality on my watch.
D1M02_19_JESSE_9047: There’s the etching.
D1M02_20_BOARD_9053: < We are nearly Whole/Fixed >
D1M02_20_BOARD_9054: < Your Trust/Synergy is appreciated >
D1M02_20_JESSE_9055: They sure changed their tune all of a sudden.
D1M02_21_JESSE_9056: [0.00-3.94]I’m overthinking this whole Board-Former thing.[4.32-8.62]They can sort out their own business, so long as it doesn’t get in my way.
D1M02_21_JESSE_9057: Obsessing over these problems is something Trench would do.
D1M02_21_JESSE_9058: [0.00-1.96]But I’ve got my intuition.[2.60-3.09]And you.
D1M02_23_JESSE_9064: [0.11-1.78]Marshall blew up the Nail?[2.23-3.72]What the hell was she thinking?
D1M02_24_JESSE_9065: [0.00-0.68]Alright.[1.05-2.30]This is the last one.
D1M02_25_FORMER_9070: < Nail @#$@# Leave @#$@ End >
D1M02_25_JESSE_9067: [0.00-0.43]There.[0.89-2.03]Easy as pi-
D1M02_25_JESSE_9068: [0.00-0.64]Fuck![1.17-2.36]But that’s the last one![3.14-4.55]I fixed it, didn’t I?
D1M02_25_JESSE_9069: [0.03-0.59]Board![0.59-1.65]What’s going on?
D1M02_25_JESSE_9071: [0.34-0.87]Former?[0.87-3.27]I don’t understand!
D1M02_25_JESSE_9072: I need to talk to Emily.
D1M02_25_JESSE_9073: [0.38-1.82]It’s not letting me out.[2.44-3.51]Where’s the exit?
D1M02_25_JESSE_9074: No! 
D1M02_25_JESSE_9075: Let me out of here!
D1M02_25_JESSE_9076: The crystal!
D1M02_25_JESSE_9077: Holy shit.
D1M02_25_JESSE_9078: The crystal’s making a path for me.
D1M02_25_JESSE_9079: Oh, thank god.
D1M02_25_JESSE_9148: [0.20-0.70]What?[1.08-2.43]Where’d the exit go?
D1M02_25_JESSE_9149: [0.03-1.28]The exit![1.73-2.46]Shit![2.98-3.76]Now what?
D1M02_25_JESSE_9150: [0.00-2.29]It’s... beautiful.
D1M02_25_JESSE_9151: Gotta jump for it!
D1M02_25_JESSE_9152: There's the exit!
D1M03_01_JESSE_9235: [0.07-2.05]What the hell was all that?[2.76-5.27]Things should be better now, not worse!
D1M03_01_JESSE_9236: [0.00-0.87]Emily will know.[1.59-2.25]I hope.
D1M03_03_JESSE_9239: [0.48-2.06]I thought you could tell me![3.08-5.93]I completed the four rituals, just like the Board told me to.[5.96-7.73]The Astral Bleed should have stopped.
D1M03_03_JESSE_9245: [0.86-2.35]I messed this all up.[3.16-5.54]Maybe Marshall was right to destroy the Nail.[6.94-8.34]I should have left it in pieces.
D1M03_03_JESSE_9247: [0.54-1.13]No.[2.01-3.91]I need to fix this, now.[4.77-5.34]I’ll just...
D1M03_03_JESSE_9248: I’ll figure something out.
D1M03_03_JESSE_9250: [0.49-0.98]Perfect.[1.65-3.26]I’ll head down and take care of whatever’s going on.[3.84-5.30]Just do what you can from here.
D1M03_03_JESSE_9252: [0.44-1.50]I have to, Emily![1.50-4.05]I’m the Director.[5.60-7.27]This is on me.
D1M03_03_POPE_9237: [0.35-0.77]Jesse![0.77-1.78]We need to talk!
D1M03_03_POPE_9238: [0.23-1.17]What did you do?[1.17-2.85]What is causing these tremors?
D1M03_03_POPE_9240: [0.58-1.53]It has stopped.[1.53-2.70]The Nail is repaired.
D1M03_03_POPE_9241: [0.41-1.62]But we have a new problem.[2.16-6.65]My analysis of the Nail indicates that it is literally a piece of the Astral Plane.
D1M03_03_POPE_9242: [0.42-2.61]Or possibly a vessel containing the Astral Plane.[3.38-4.02]Or both?
D1M03_03_POPE_9243: [0.20-5.38]Either way, right now both dimensions are vibrating at completely incompatible frequencies.[5.78-9.08]The spatial friction they’re generating is incalculable.
D1M03_03_POPE_9244: It’s going to destroy both planes.
D1M03_03_POPE_9246: [0.36-2.62]Then the Astral Plane would still be leaking in.[3.66-5.69]Sometimes there’s no right answer, Jesse.[6.59-7.73]We need more information.
D1M03_03_POPE_9249: [0.58-2.62]We should really make a plan.[3.10-6.80]The tremors are originating from directly below us, but we don’t know-
D1M03_03_POPE_9251: Jesse, you can’t just-
D1M03_04_JESSE_9253: I hope I know what I’m doing...
D1M03_05_JESSE_9254: [0.13-2.28]That was just the top of the Nail?[2.87-5.25]How much deeper does the Foundation go?
D1M03_06_JESSE_9255: [0.00-2.36]The crystals are growing like crazy here.[3.03-4.71]It’s almost like they’re trying to stop me.
D1M03_06_JESSE_9262: When Marshall blew up the Nail, the Board attacked her.
D1M03_06_JESSE_9263: I don’t fucking like it.
D1M03_07_FORMER_9624: < Assistance $#%# Sent @$#& Champion !%#* Endure>
D1M03_07_JESSE_9269: She can destroy the crystals too?
D1M03_07_JESSE_9270: More Hiss?
D1M03_07_JESSE_9271: Oh come on!
D1M03_07_JESSE_9272: [0.41-0.94]What?[1.51-2.35]Out of ammo?
D1M03_07_JESSE_9273: Sorry I wasn’t here to help, Marshall.
D1M03_08_JESSE_9274: [0.00-1.40]The Nail is corrupted...[1.78-5.84]That explains why the Board wasn’t answering, and what’s causing the quakes.
D1M03_08_JESSE_9275: [0.13-2.43]Marshall came down here to stop this.[2.98-3.88]I should’ve been with her.[3.88-5.95]I could’ve saved her.
D1M03_08_JESSE_9276: But I can still save everyone else.
D1M03_09_BOARD_9277: < We are Cleansed/Liberated/Hallelujah! >
D1M03_09_BOARD_9278: < The Foundation is Stable/Beaten/A-OK > 
D1M03_09_BOARD_9279: < We are resuming Authority/Busybodying > 
D1M03_09_BOARD_9280: < We hope you will improve your Attitude/Loyalty >
D1M03_09_JESSE_9281: Well, fuck you too.
D1M03_09_JESSE_9282: Oh, I’ll be sure to.
D1M03_09_JESSE_9283: [0.03-1.18]Let’s play it smart.[1.56-2.94]They don’t need to know I’m onto them.[3.64-4.86]Not yet, anyway.
D1M03_10_JESSE_9284: [0.03-4.05]I thought I’d know how to handle things, now that I’m the Director.[5.60-8.22]Clearly it’s not that simple.
D1M03_10_JESSE_9285: [0.33-1.35]Emily was right.[1.70-4.60]I need to understand what I’m doing before I do it.[5.24-6.62]No more shots in the dark.[7.20-10.93]Trench had his faults, but he knew that much.[11.80-14.03]He kept this place standing for a long time.
D1M03_10_JESSE_9286: [0.05-1.44]Well, him and Marshall.[1.92-3.20]Credit where credit’s due.
D1M03_10_JESSE_9287: [0.22-2.62]I need to choose a direction for the Bureau.[3.22-7.14]It should be one that serves our goals, not the Board’s...[7.79-8.88]whatever those are.
D1M03_10_JESSE_9288: I need to lead my way.
D1SM01_01_JESSE_9080: [0.00-1.71]Is this a Bureau ID badge?[2.10-3.49]It looks so old...[4.02-5.80]Pope’ll definitely wanna see this.
D1SM01_02_JESSE_9082: [0.45-1.80]Like their ID cards.[2.86-3.87]I picked up a weird one.[4.38-5.17]It’s pretty old.
D1SM01_02_JESSE_9084: Are you starting a collection?
D1SM01_02_JESSE_9087: [0.39-1.35]A rare one then.[2.78-3.79]Want to keep it, Emily?
D1SM01_02_JESSE_9089: Sounds like you have something in mind.
D1SM01_02_JESSE_9093: [0.34-3.65]I’m gonna assume this key is my ticket to that lower floor.[4.67-7.68]And that super secret lab you mentioned?
D1SM01_02_POPE_9081: [0.61-1.77]Jesse, you’re back![2.12-3.62]Did you find anything noteworthy?[4.00-7.99]The original Bureau expedition down here left so much interesting stuff behind!
D1SM01_02_POPE_9083: [0.27-2.66]Oh wow, look at that![2.66-4.31]I’ve found a few ID cards myself...[4.70-6.99]or more accurately, the Rangers found them for me.
D1SM01_02_POPE_9085: [0.51-1.65]I’m going for the whole set![2.25-3.49]I kid, of course.
D1SM01_02_POPE_9086: [0.61-4.88]But I suppose they are sort of like baseball cards, except for Bureau staff from the ‘60s.[6.32-6.50]Hm...[6.50-8.15]The one you’ve found is different than mine.[8.98-10.80]Looks like it’s a higher clearance level.
D1SM01_02_POPE_9088: [0.57-2.02]Yeah, I absolutely do![2.46-4.77]But I think you should hang onto it for now.
D1SM01_02_POPE_9090: [0.24-0.78]Guilty![1.47-3.45]I’ve been going through Dr. Ash’s notes.[3.45-5.56]The ones I can find anyway.[5.75-9.04]Like Darling, he seemed to enjoy hiding his most relevant research.
D1SM01_02_POPE_9091: [0.03-1.46]Here, take this.[1.91-3.29]It’s an old skeleton key.[3.98-5.49]Something else the Rangers found.
D1SM01_02_POPE_9092: I give them five bucks for every useful trinket they bring me.
D1SM01_02_POPE_9094: [0.83-3.28]Bingo bango, as Dr. Darling used to say.[3.84-7.16]Keep your eyes peeled for more ID cards around the Warehouse.[7.73-13.13]If Ash’s notes are reliable, and I’m sure they are, then five is the magic number.
D1SM01_02_POPE_9605: High clearance access might come in handy. 
D1SM01_02_POPE_9606: From what I gather, there is another floor beneath the Warehouse - with a special lab that requires five high-level staff members just to access! 
D1SM01_03_JESSE_9095: Weird place to leave an ID card but okay. 
D1SM01_03_JESSE_9096: [0.03-1.06]Another ID card...[1.78-3.97]for a cartographer.
D1SM01_03_JESSE_9097: [0.00-1.76]Another one of those ID cards.[2.41-3.55]"Security Chief."
D1SM01_03_JESSE_9098: [0.03-1.30]“Lead Physicist."[2.07-4.63]It’s got the same clearance level as the card I showed Emily.
D1SM01_03_JESSE_9099: [0.00-2.88]This ID card was for an excavation engineer.[3.61-6.27]Why did so many people abandon their cards down here?
D1SM01_04_JESSE_9100: [0.16-3.75]From the layer of dust on this place, nobody’s swept here in years.[4.22-5.32]Not even Ahti.[5.89-7.51]No way he’d stand for this.
D1SM01_04_JESSE_9101: There’s an elevator, which I’m sure is super safe, and a space in each terminal for an ID card.
D1SM01_04_JESSE_9102: But which card goes where?
D1SM01_04_JESSE_9103: That’s a lot of maps.
D1SM01_04_JESSE_9104: This person obviously liked guns.
D1SM01_04_JESSE_9105: [0.18-3.91]A physicist would probably have instruments or something...[4.71-6.32]for physics.
D1SM01_04_JESSE_9106: [0.11-3.05]One of the cards was for an excavation engineer.[3.08-5.78]I wonder which console was theirs.
D1SM01_04_JESSE_9107: [0.00-0.86]It worked![1.43-5.91]Now I just have to get on a rickety elevator that goes who knows how far down.
D1SM01_05_JESSE_9108: [0.03-1.13]More dust.[1.82-5.07]Still, this lab’s way tidier than any of Darling’s.
D1SM01_05_JESSE_9109: Why would they need such a heavy door down here?
D1SM01_06_JESSE_9110: [0.13-1.35]This looks like the Nail...[1.79-3.40]only, mini.
D1SM01_06_JESSE_9111: [0.10-1.02]A document...[1.75-3.42]Is this in some kind of code?[4.38-5.97]I can’t read a word of it.
D1SM01_06_JESSE_9112: I should take this back to Emily, and tell her I got into Ash’s secret lab.
D1SM01_07_JESSE_9113: I found Ash’s secret lab.
D1SM01_07_JESSE_9115: [0.38-3.15]Uh well, there was another cave.[3.54-6.52]The walls were covered in paintings of eyeballs.[7.18-10.21]The research seemed dedicated to studying a kind of...[11.76-13.62]smaller version of the Nail?[14.57-17.77]It looked like the same material as the one up here, but just a different shape.
D1SM01_07_JESSE_9117: [0.25-1.75]None, sorry.[2.56-4.22]I did find this handwritten note.
D1SM01_07_JESSE_9120: Have you ever thought about taking a vacation, Emily?
D1SM01_07_POPE_9114: [0.37-1.12]Excellent.[1.67-2.84]Please, tell me everything.[2.94-4.21]Spare no details!
D1SM01_07_POPE_9116: [0.81-3.79]Are you sure you didn’t see any functioning prototypes?[4.29-6.30]Or at least some schematics?[6.86-9.57]Dr. Ash was a very accomplished engineer.
D1SM01_07_POPE_9118: [0.38-1.12]Wow.[2.03-3.79]Ash had terrible handwriting.[4.83-6.42]Never meet your heroes, right?
D1SM01_07_POPE_9119: [0.38-4.74]It looks like a transcribed conversation between Ash and someone named “F”.[6.21-8.49]Ooh, this is juicy.[8.85-10.53]This'll take me days to parse out.[10.94-11.73]Maybe weeks!
D1SM01_07_POPE_9121: [0.29-1.04]Are you kidding?[1.75-3.42]This is my vacation, Jesse!
D1SM02_01_JESSE_9122: [0.30-1.94]“Properly trained".[2.95-3.97]Guess I pass.[4.54-6.51]I’m VERY properly trained.
D1SM02_02_JESSE_9123: [0.45-1.67]I remember that camera.[2.77-4.09]How the hell did it get out?[5.40-6.80]Are the Hiss shooting movies now?
D1SM02_03_JESSE_9125: Well this is one way to catch up quick!
D1SM02_03_JESSE_9126: [0.47-1.56]After that camera![2.03-3.11]And step on it!
D1SM02_03_JESSE_9127: [0.25-1.73]Thought you could lose me, huh...[4.13-5.35]Why am I talking to a camera?
D1SM02_04_JESSE_9128: No way am I sharing the spotlight with Hiss!
D1SM02_05_JESSE_9129: Train’s full.
D1SM02_06_JESSE_9130: Hang on!
D1SM02_06_JESSE_9131: Get your own platform!
D1SM02_06_JESSE_9132: You’re too tall for this ride.
D1SM02_07_JESSE_9133: Almost had it!
D1SM02_10_JESSE_9134: Ready for your close up?
D1SM02_11_JESSE_9135: [0.33-0.69]Wait.[0.82-1.30]What?[2.51-3.13]We’re back?
D1SM02_11_JESSE_9136: Did that really just happen? It felt like a dream. Or maybe a bad movie...
D1SM03_02_JESSE_9137: [0.00-2.11]“Dangerous material”, huh.[2.99-5.03]I wonder what kind of dangerous.
D1SM03_02_JESSE_9138: [0.13-3.03]Oh THAT kind of dangerous.[3.66-6.15]Guess these skeletons didn’t read the warning.
D1SM03_02_JESSE_9139: [0.03-1.73]I think I see some light down there.[2.30-4.72]Maybe the “dangerous material” didn’t get very far.
D1SM03_02_JESSE_9140: [0.27-1.69]I can’t see a thing.[2.50-4.00]Maybe I should’ve thought this through...
D1SM03_03_JESSE_9141: [0.00-0.77]The light.[1.57-3.14]Another TV?
D1SM03_03_JESSE_9142: [0.03-1.93]There’s a Betamax attached.[2.94-4.60]We had one of those when I was a kid.[5.40-8.49]Mom called it the "superior format".
D1SM03_03_JESSE_9143: [0.00-1.33]It’s so dark.[2.28-4.45]How am I supposed to drag this thing out of here?
D1SM03_03_JESSE_9144: [0.00-1.32]This is fine, Jesse.[2.11-2.75]You’re okay.[3.15-5.03]Just don’t drop the TV.
D1SM03_03_JESSE_9145: There’s the way out, up there.
D1SM03_04_JESSE_9146: [0.00-0.92]Back at the cell.[2.15-2.97]Thank god.
D1SM03_04_JESSE_9147: [0.00-1.42]Guess the Beta stays here.[1.70-3.24]It’s probably best I lock it up.
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10340: What was I talking about again? Oh yeah...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10341: Hmm. Lost my train of thought. Oh, right...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10342: As I was saying...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10343: Like I was saying before...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10344: I feel like I’m doing all the talking. But anyway...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10345: So, like I was saying...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10346: You are listening to me, right? Yeah, of course you are...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10347: Hey, you’re back. So, anyway...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10348: Welcome back. Like I was saying before...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10349: Oh, there you are! Anyway...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10350: Oh hey, thought I’d lost you. But like I was saying...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10351: There’s our Director! Now, getting back to the matter at hand...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10352: Look who’s back! Anyway, as I was saying...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10353: It’s hard to track you on all these cameras. Anyway...
D2_AMB_BRIDGE_FL_01_LANGSTON_10354: Look who it is! So anyway, like I was saying before...
D2_AMB_FL_01_JESSE_10047: [0.00-1.85]“Doesn’t want to brag."[3.11-3.78]Right.
D2_AMB_FL_01_JESSE_10052: He’s just going to talk forever, isn’t he?
D2_AMB_FL_01_JESSE_10058: [0.03-0.53]Wow.[1.50-2.84]That’s kinda harsh.
D2_AMB_FL_01_JESSE_10060: Real smooth, Langston.
D2_AMB_FL_01_LANGSTON_10046: [0.05-3.24]It’s just nice to have someone to talk to, you know?[3.87-7.75]Ever since I got put in charge of the Panopticon, people treat me different.[7.77-10.72]Like I’m “crazy” for wanting to work with Altered Items.[11.46-15.60]People just don’t understand the Altered Items like I do, you know?[16.46-21.23]I don’t want to brag, but it does take a very empathetic mind to connect with the Items.
D2_AMB_FL_01_LANGSTON_10048: [0.05-3.65]Still, I don’t know why people are making it so personal.[4.19-9.17]I mean, the teams in Research handle paranatural materials every day and no one thinks they’re weird.[9.95-11.15]Well, maybe that’s not true.[11.17-13.55]Darling is famous for being a bit out there.[13.58-16.40]But when he’s weird, it’s “charming”.
D2_AMB_FL_01_LANGSTON_10049: [0.03-4.06]Altered Items really aren’t that frightening once you get to know them.[4.31-10.93]If you figure out what they like or don’t like, you know, what sets them off, then there’s nothing to worry about.[11.56-16.47]I guess at the end of the day we’re still just wild animals scared of our own shadows.
D2_AMB_FL_01_LANGSTON_10050: [0.03-8.78]We’re supposed to be on the same team here, but sometimes it feels like it’s every department for themselves, like it’s a race and we’re all trying to be number one.[9.61-14.45]If it IS a race though, I’d say Darling is a mile ahead of everyone else.
D2_AMB_FL_01_LANGSTON_10051: [0.00-6.74]He was Trench’s golden boy for years but that relationship has gotten pretty tense, or so I’ve heard through the grapevine.[7.23-8.57]Not that I spread rumors.[8.60-10.66]Just, you know, people talk.[11.02-11.65]Not me though.[11.87-13.69]I keep my nose to the grind.[14.15-16.34]Too much work to do to focus on those kinds of things.[16.34-20.01]I need to stay focused so I can get my work done and get home to feed Alfred.
D2_AMB_FL_01_LANGSTON_10053: [0.03-6.44]Of course, can’t always make it home for mealtime, so I have my neighbor check in on Alfred at seven o’clock if I’m not back yet.[6.78-7.95]She’s very nice.[7.96-9.00]Her name is Maria.[9.55-10.35]She’s older.[10.37-13.79]She came to New York in the '50s to attend school and has been here ever since.[14.17-15.35]She has a couple kids.[15.37-16.29]I met them at Thanksgiving.[16.32-17.05]Big family.[17.73-18.55]Very nice people.
D2_AMB_FL_01_LANGSTON_10054: [0.04-3.86]Anyway, she has a key to my apartment and she gives Alfred his dinner if I’m not home.[4.06-7.88]I’m gonna have to buy her a nice fruit arrangement as a “thank you” after this.[8.23-10.70]I’m missing a LOT of Alfred’s mealtimes.[11.16-13.28]She’s probably gonna have to go to the store for more wet food.[13.78-15.35]I’ll have to remember to pay her back.[15.99-17.06]Hold on, let me make a note.
D2_AMB_FL_01_LANGSTON_10055: [0.00-10.88]Pay. Back. Maria. For. Alfred’s. Food.[11.17-11.72]OK.[12.13-13.11]Oh, one more thing.[14.47-25.00]And. Buy. Her. A. Fruit. Arrangement.[26.32-27.42]Alright, done.
D2_AMB_FL_01_LANGSTON_10056: [0.04-1.19]Are you a cat person?[1.41-2.57]I don’t think I ever asked.[2.60-3.54]You seem like one though.[4.00-5.15]You’d like Alfred.[5.17-6.70]He’s very proper.[6.73-8.83]Really carries himself well, you know?[9.40-11.22]I named him after my favorite poet.[11.49-12.35]It felt like a good fit.[13.02-18.39]I got Alfred just before Sylvia died, when I was at the...[18.42-21.29]huh, you know I don’t really remember where I got from Alfred from.[22.16-26.13]But, boy, those two did NOT get along.[26.15-27.67]No, no, no.
D2_AMB_FL_01_LANGSTON_10057: [0.03-2.01]Sylvia thought she owned the place.[2.20-3.50]Didn’t like me getting in her way.[3.52-7.10]Scratched me more than once when I was just trying to move her food bowl.[7.76-9.51]That cat was a real asshole.
D2_AMB_FL_01_LANGSTON_10059: [0.05-5.10]I’m realizing now that that language was not entirely, uh, professional.[6.12-9.14]You see, Sylvia didn’t tolerate most people.[10.25-10.88]Or animals.[11.71-12.85]Or anything.[13.51-16.18]That’s what I meant when I said “asshole”.[16.91-18.81]I would never use that word about a person.[18.85-22.65]It was just a, you know, a...[22.71-24.93]Hey! There’s a light flashing on the console here.[24.93-27.58]I gotta, uh, check this out.[27.80-29.68]I’ll get back to you later.
D2_AMB_FL_02_JESSE_10126: Oh, it’s definitely on.
D2_AMB_FL_02_JESSE_10132: [0.00-0.72]Wake.[1.91-4.67]It can’t be a coincidence that I saw him in the Motel.[6.43-9.08]Was he drawn here by the investigation?
D2_AMB_FL_02_JESSE_10139: I am so curious, yet so concerned.
D2_AMB_FL_02_JESSE_10147: He’s really tackling the important issues, huh?
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10122: [0.03-2.07]You guys are gonna escort me, right?[2.77-3.39]OK, good.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10123: [0.07-3.36]Hmm, that was inconclusive.[3.88-6.34]You shoot so often it’s hard to know when it’s intentional.[7.05-9.81]There also could be a delay on this video feed.[10.90-12.46]Maybe the system just needs a reboot.[13.05-15.84]This is a good opportunity to use the restroom anyway.[16.23-17.11]Stay safe, ma’am!
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10124: [0.00-0.60]Hello?[1.41-5.57]If you can hear me, uh, shoot something.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10125: [0.03-2.00]Let me check...[2.05-2.60]okay...[2.64-5.90]the wires down here.[6.92-12.96]Huh, looks like it should be working.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10127: [0.05-1.73]Hm, I didn’t see you nod.[2.54-3.63]Is this thing not on?
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10128: [0.05-2.84]Hey, did you know we own Night Springs?[3.27-6.66]Yeah, the Bureau bought the rights after the original series ended.[7.12-13.25]I’ve sent some story suggestions to the production team, but apparently they “are not accepting pitches at this time."[13.91-14.51]Typical.[15.35-17.50]I’d be a great addition to their team, right?
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10129: [0.04-7.02]The forums all call the unfinished book “Departure” because Wake kept saying it would be a departure from his previous work.[7.65-11.19]I found some pages that are supposedly the real deal on the internet.[12.12-13.99]It’s pretty dark stuff.[14.23-22.00]He was going full horror, which makes sense since he used to write for Night Springs, but I would have preferred if he did something a little lighter.[22.42-25.32]I’ve always said Wake had a great instinct for humor.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10130: [0.05-5.71]Apparently there were chapters of an unfinished manuscript floating around after Wake disappeared.[6.21-11.55]People say they’re cursed, which is a very discriminatory term against altered materials by the way.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10131: [0.05-5.62]They’re making a movie of the series, but the guy who plays Casey doesn’t have enough gravel in his voice, you know?[6.21-10.09]I remember being so pissed when Wake killed off Casey in the books.[10.80-12.28]It’s not a huge surprise though.[12.74-14.47]Wake sounded like a bit of a dick.[14.73-21.69]Drank too much, fought paparazzi, the tabloids even said he was an abusive husband, so, yeah.[21.93-23.43]Troubled artists and all that.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10133: [0.03-4.40]I got really interested when I heard Alan Wake was involved with the latest occurrence.[4.58-5.79]I’m a huge Wake fan.[6.22-7.78]I love the Alex Casey novels.[7.78-11.67]That over-the-top hardboiled detective thing is right up my alley.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10134: [0.03-1.53]It’s a strange case.[1.78-6.51]Most AWEs are one and done, but Bright Falls has pretty regular flare-ups.[6.73-10.56]Three incidents since 1970, when we first started tracking it.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10135: [0.05-1.34]What were we talking about before?[1.81-3.24]Right, the evacuation![3.56-8.71]Yeah, I heard afterward that the Hartman specimen had gotten loose and killed some staff.[9.16-16.48]They had me digitizing records in some dark corner of the sector, so I didn’t know a whole lot about the Bright Falls investigation at the time.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10136: [0.05-1.59]Ah, classic.[2.33-7.72]I’ve moved on to less mainstream instruments now, but the tuba will always be a part of me.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10137: (hums some of “In the Hall of the Mountain King”)


D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10138: [0.05-1.43]Do you play any instruments?[2.09-4.29]I could see you being a guitarist.[4.32-5.59]Maybe a bassist.[6.17-8.58]It’s funny, I played the tuba in high school band.[8.96-11.84]My favorite was “In the Hall of the Mountain King”.[12.11-15.70]Tuba didn’t get a lot of spotlight in most of the songs Mrs. McKinley chose,[15.73-18.88]but “Mountain King” was my time to shine.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10140: [0.04-5.41]One really helpful thing she had me do was find a creative outlet.[6.08-12.11]I started doing some experimental music slash poetry that I think was really ahead of its time.[12.45-13.51]This was years back.[14.12-16.99]I’m cooking up some pretty new sounds these days.[17.26-20.60]Think My Bleeding Clock meets Sylvia Plath.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10141: [0.03-4.17]She did help me realize that I’m processing stress in an unhealthy way.[4.60-7.95]I try not to carry all that around with me anymore, but it does stack up.[8.61-11.97]Hard to just say, “No, thank you” to the anxiety buzzing in your head.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10142: [0.05-7.49]I kept waiting for that big “a-ha” moment, you know, where I realize that my need for approval stems from my dad or something.[8.29-11.79]Turns out therapy doesn’t work like that, so I stopped going.[12.75-16.61]TV really gives you a skewed understanding of these kind of things.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10143: [0.03-1.41]I stopped going a few years back.[1.95-3.20]To my therapist, I mean.[3.91-7.94]She said that a lot of my issues stemmed from a “negative outlook”.[8.54-12.65]Of course, I can’t tell her anything about what I do so I just had to sit there and nod.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10144: [0.04-5.11]And then, after three hours of questions, they recommended we all go for trauma counseling.[5.35-8.60]I was like, no thanks, I have my own therapist.[9.19-14.57]I know I could use the work therapist and save a few bucks but I worry they’re gonna put anything I say in a file somewhere.[14.99-20.58]A bit paranoid I know, but I do work for a secret government organization so, yeah.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10145: [0.24-3.43]But yeah, they locked the whole area down tight.[3.45-4.42]No one in or out.[4.82-7.96]And then they marched us all BACK to Executive to interview everyone.[8.44-12.60]I wasn’t even there when it happened and they were asking me if I noticed anything suspicious,[12.62-16.35] if I saw anyone tampering with the containment cell, and so on.[16.38-20.41]The only thing they learned was why I prefer the ruffled chips to the non-ruffled ones.[21.06-23.23]Better mouthfeel, like I said before.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10146: [0.03-4.94]Anyway, I get back to the elevator and they tell me the sector is being evacuated.[5.15-7.10]They wouldn’t even let me go back in for my stuff.[7.35-8.49]Can you believe that?[9.04-11.21]I worked at that desk for years![11.24-18.55]I had photos on it, my favorite stapler, one of those good ones that could staple a 50-page report no problem,[18.57-23.16]a little cash, and some, uh, personal recordings.
D2_AMB_FL_02_LANGSTON_10148: [0.05-3.56]You know, I was in the Investigations Sector when it was evacuated.[3.98-5.31]Well, not THERE there.[5.34-8.01]I was in Executive because they have the best snack machines.[8.37-12.55]You may think they’re all the same because of that plain white packaging, but there’s a difference.[12.97-14.66]You know those thick ruffled potato chips?[14.94-15.63]They’re my favorite.[16.24-20.49]All the machines outside Executive carry those flimsy little thin chips.[20.60-21.64]They have no texture.[21.85-23.64]I may was well eat cardboard.
D2_AMB_FL_03_JESSE_10149: [0.08-0.85]Wow.[1.73-2.74]That was...[4.17-4.91]passionate.
D2_AMB_FL_03_JESSE_10159: [0.00-1.84]What “you and me”?[2.86-5.36]My gun is the coolest.
D2_AMB_FL_03_JESSE_10163: Obviously.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10150: [2.05-6.20]Sorry, I got a little, uh, carried away there.[7.07-12.48]Uh, woof, I’m gonna just…[13.10-15.30]I’m gonna just sit down for a second.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10151: [0.04-3.20]I guess it’s no surprise we can’t empathize with appliances.[3.55-6.39]Hell, we can’t even empathize with our own species properly![6.73-9.82]We kill and imprison people and never think twice![10.05-11.45]We’re the real monsters![11.61-13.61]They should lock US up in the Panopticon![14.24-16.75]The Altered Items are just victims of circumstance![16.99-18.30]They never asked to be altered![18.64-22.09]But hey let’s just put them in jail instead of trying to help them![22.33-24.25]Because that would require a heart![24.40-27.76]That would require the ability to feel something other than hate-[27.78-32.46]and envy and self-centered stupid god damn idiot lizard-brain narcissism!
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10152: [0.03-2.09]There is no fate or synchronicity.[2.32-8.00]There is trauma, going on forever like a chain connecting everything through mutual pain.[8.74-11.09]My Altered Items are just links on that chain.[11.67-14.75]We need to help these poor objects, not treat them like criminals.[15.53-20.04]Just because a refrigerator can’t tell you it’s in pain doesn’t mean it’s not.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10153: [0.07-4.73]The stock broker lost millions because a company selling mining equipment went bankrupt,[4.75-8.98]which happened because a mine in Northern Canada collapsed because of a faulty brace,[9.00-12.67] which I’m sure was faulty because some factory worker made a mistake,[12.69-15.87] which was only because he was tired because of blah blah blah.[16.78-17.81]You get the point.[18.56-22.02]Everything has a cause, which leads to an effect,[22.04-24.52]which then serves as the cause for something else.[24.71-26.75]And on and on and on.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10154: [0.06-2.33]You know, I never bought into that garbage.[2.58-5.25]The entire theory seems way too convenient to me.[5.63-11.33]Things happen because they happen, not because of some metaphysical alignment of intentions or whatever.[12.05-15.17]And I’m not talking about fate, I don’t even want to open that can of worms.[15.37-20.75]No, what I’m saying is that one force acts, and the universe feels it.[20.99-22.61]Action, reaction.[23.14-26.47]A stock broker jumps off a building and lands on a fire hydrant,[26.50-30.90]a year later the fire hydrant becomes altered and fills a city block with poisonous gas.[31.19-32.52]83 people die.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10155: [0.04-5.46]You will not believe this, but I just found a silver dollar on the ground.[5.99-7.53]One of those Sacagawea ones.[8.20-10.59]We were just talking about money and a dollar shows up.[11.22-14.27]Synchronicity, as those dweebs in Research would say.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10156: [0.06-1.87]Also, hazard pay![2.40-5.19]What exactly is our policy on hazard pay?[5.55-11.13]We could be making a pretty penny right now, given all the, you know, hazards.[11.92-15.01]I can’t tell you how many times- Hey, is that a quarter?
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10157: [0.03-4.57]I know everyone carrying guns may not be appropriate in a workplace environment,[4.95-9.73]but we here at the FBC face some pretty dangerous stuff on a fairly regular basis.[10.61-14.30]I can start a petition and get some signatures on your desk if you think that would be helpful.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10158: [0.04-2.32]This is a good segue into another issue.[2.69-6.60]I think all staff should be trained in the use of firearms.[7.30-9.47]I mean, if a Hiss gets in here, what am I going to do?[9.95-13.52]Throw my copy of Panopticon Safety Protocols and Regulations at it?[13.87-14.82]I’m a sitting duck.[15.58-18.92]Upper middle-management should have a way to defend themselves.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10160: [0.05-2.15]I think they have superiority complexes.[2.78-7.01]Just because they get the cool guns doesn’t mean they’re more important than you and me.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10161: [0.00-1.48]Yeah, you two heard me.[1.97-4.57]Oh, yeah, just keep doing robot voices.[4.59-6.15]That’s super helpful.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10162: [0.05-4.98]I knew the Investigations Sector was a dead end so I was always on the lookout for a transfer.[5.09-8.83]When a spot opened up in the Panopticon I jumped on it like a cat.[9.41-12.03]A cat motivated by professional development.[12.72-13.54]I never looked back.[14.52-21.94]Except for the things I had to leave at my desk when we evacuated, I did actually try to pay a Ranger to go back in and get those.[22.24-23.45]They refused.[23.67-27.47]They even told Marshall, who chewed me out for like an hour.[28.07-29.88]There’s a good lesson for you, ma’am.[30.09-32.45]Rangers are tattletales.[32.97-33.69]Don’t trust them.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10164: [0.04-4.50]Some people said Trench didn’t like Internal Investigations looking into his management team.[4.88-7.19]All I know is what I heard around the watercooler.[7.70-9.79]I was pretty low on the totem pole back then.[10.27-11.93]Did data entry mostly.[12.15-14.74]Keep your head down and do your work, that’s my motto.[15.42-18.73]Got me to where I am today so obviously it’s a pretty good one.
D2_AMB_FL_03_LANGSTON_10165: [0.09-1.72]Kirklund was a good boss.[2.05-5.30]He treated everyone fair, which is pretty rare around here.[5.84-9.46]It was tough for him to see his department suffer, I think that’s what made him quit.[9.98-12.78]We were overworked and understaffed after the Hartman incident.[13.00-18.08]I don’t know what was going on with him and Trench but there were rumors flying around like crazy.
D2_AMB_FL_04_JESSE_10108: Why, thank you.
D2_AMB_FL_04_JESSE_10111: No, it did not.
D2_AMB_FL_04_JESSE_10117: Goldfish have better attention spans than this guy.
D2_AMB_FL_04_JESSE_10121: Bye, Langston.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10105: [0.04-1.12]Do you read horoscopes?[1.82-2.23]I do.[2.61-3.64]They’re very handy.[3.64-7.93]Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think the planets are aligning to dictate my entire life,[7.95-10.05]but, you know, it’s kind of comforting.[10.84-12.54]I bet you’re a...[13.30-14.72]an Aries.[14.80-15.76]Am I right?[15.89-17.13]I’m right, aren’t I?[17.23-18.11]Knew it.[18.66-19.69]I’m a Taurus.[20.03-23.08]Lots of trust between those two signs, so that’s good.[23.08-25.08]It means we’re gonna do great things together.[25.73-28.11]Look at how we’re already tackling this Hartman problem.[28.11-30.60]We’ve got this cat in the bag.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10106: I never realized what a horrible phrase that is.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10107: [0.05-5.73]Anyway, this whole Hartman thing has been tearing the Bureau apart for two years now.[5.77-8.47]Kirklund, the old sector head, even resigned over it.[8.85-11.75]But you just rushed in and took the problem into your own hands.[11.97-13.51]That’s leadership![13.54-17.83]No politics, no blame, just good honest work.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10109: [0.06-1.04]That’s how I work too.[1.45-4.00]I come in, get to work, and leave at 5.[4.05-5.07]No exceptions.[5.78-7.68]Well, some exceptions.[7.70-10.81]When the building is on mandatory lockdown for example.[11.40-16.61]Or when someone spills their soda on Altered Item 14 and I have to stay late to oversee the clean up[16.63-20.91]because they needed someone to sing to it while that weird old janitor wiped the soda off.[21.09-24.46]All because Ted had to take his soda into the cell with him,[24.48-28.39]even though food and drink are expressly forbidden inside Panopticon cells.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10110: [0.05-5.25]And then you have to go talk to HR about getting Ted reassigned to Maintenance, which is a whole thing.[5.43-7.24]Not that I’m vindictive.[7.26-13.51]I just, uh, you know, thought that working in Maintenance would give Ted a chance to realize the importance of,[13.53-17.24]uh, cleanliness and, uh, proper, you know, sanitation.[17.69-17.90]Yeah.[18.35-20.06]It’s good for him.[20.06-23.11]And you know, when he’s done, we can re-evaluate.[23.31-24.69]Assuming he’s still alive.[24.87-28.38]Not to be morbid, but I mean, this Ted issue may have taken care of itself.[29.27-30.92]Uh, that didn’t come out right.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10112: [0.07-8.47]Ted may, uh, have fallen in the line of duty and, uh, may no longer require a position here at the Bureau.[9.25-10.75]You know what I mean.[10.78-12.06]Let’s all pray for Ted.[12.37-13.69]Not that I assume you pray.[14.43-18.03]I grew up in a pretty religious household, so it’s just something we said.[18.43-21.56]Like “good luck” or “break a leg”.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10113: [0.05-4.95]Everyone is real touchy about religion around here, so I don’t want to offend anyone.[5.48-11.68]It’s funny how just because we handle all of these paranatural things, everyone assumes religions are automatically out the window.[11.71-14.34]I mean, I kinda see it as the opposite.[15.18-18.75]If a talking Christmas tree is real, then why not some judgmental sky people?[19.48-22.34]The more we think we know, the less we think is possible.[22.89-23.45]What’s that from?[24.38-24.91]Doesn’t matter.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10114: [0.04-3.95]Boy, I could use some lunch, but I’m getting pretty sick of these rations.[3.95-7.02]Today was supposed to be chicken parmesan day in the cafeteria.[7.45-8.81]God, that sounds good right now.[9.58-16.50]I usually bring my own lunch because the ingredients they use here aren’t the freshest, but they really do make a great chicken parm.[16.87-20.70]The breading is kept crispy, even once it’s in the sauce.[21.30-22.23]Don’t know how they manage it.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10115: [0.03-2.68]Man, I really hope the kitchen staff survived.[3.60-6.38]They’re just, you know, bystanders in all of this.[7.07-11.34]Oh, that reminds me, I’m gonna log this whole thing as field experience.[11.58-16.55]I only need 26 more hours until I can get field agent status along with my supervisor role.[17.10-20.02]It gives me access to class 2 weapons and a small pay bump.[20.04-22.92]Don’t worry, I wouldn’t ever actually see any action.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10116: [0.05-8.84]I’ve put in, let’s see, uh, I’m gonna round up to four hours for now and then, you know, let’s see what happens.[9.46-10.33]Oh, another thing![10.64-11.75]Business cards.[12.04-13.19]What’s our policy on them?[13.52-17.97]I know as a secretive federal agency we may not want staff handing out their details,[17.99-2.53] but I think it’s important that we’re able to identify our status in the organization when it’s required.[23.89-28.92]I mean, you’re the Director and you’re new, so I’m sure you’ll be wanting to order some cards, right?[29.51-34.22]And if you’re already putting in an order, then we may as well make sure everyone is covered, if they want to be.[34.98-36.73]I’m just asking you to think about it.[36.73-37.86]No pressure.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10118: [0.03-1.67]Anyway, we were discussing lunch![1.69-4.14]I’m gonna go have a ration pack.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10119: [0.05-1.09]Do you guys want any?[1.29-6.05]Or are you gonna say “we do not require nourishment” or some other robot nonsense?[7.33-8.56]Fine, well I’m gonna go eat.
D2_AMB_FL_04_LANGSTON_10120: [0.05-1.54]You should get some lunch too, ma’am.[1.73-6.05]I mean, that sector’s been closed off for two years, so I wouldn’t recommend eating anything you find in there.[6.63-8.86]But I’m sure you can find something back in Executive.[9.43-11.74]OK, well, talk to you soon.[12.29-12.93]Be careful![13.54-14.36]Langston out.[15.52-16.42]I always wanted to say that.[17.15-17.44]Over.[18.48-19.09]Over and out?[19.35-20.00]Is that what you say?[20.66-21.12]Uh...[21.91-22.71]over and out.[24.81-25.23]Goodbye.
D2_GEN_01_JESSE_10166: [0.00-0.73]Hello?[2.29-3.36]Anyone here?
D2_GEN_01_JESSE_10167: Guess not.
D2_GEN_01_JESSE_10168: [0.00-2.82]Hmm, it’s not working.[4.46-6.63]Probably a loose Power Core somewhere.
D2_GEN_01_JESSE_10169: [0.00-0.59]There.[1.23-2.63]Now that gate should open.
D2_GEN_01_JESSE_10170: [0.66-1.25]Whoa.[2.17-5.09]Looks like the House has gotten a little wild in here.
D2_GEN_01_JESSE_10171: What is that noise?
D2_GEN_01_JESSE_10172: [0.00-2.53]This looks like the power switch.[4.47-5.95]Doesn’t seem to be working.
D2_GEN_01_JESSE_10173: Let’s give the elevator another try.
D2_GEN_01_JESSE_10197: [0.06-3.55]OK, well he can’t hide in here anymore.[4.48-7.79]Let’s go clear out the other AWE wing.
D2_GEN_02_JESSE_10198: I can move the crane light from here.
D2_GEN_02_JESSE_10199: I’ll need to move that light on the crane.
D2_GEN_02_JESSE_10200: I’ll have to move that crane light to reach the Power Cores.
D2_GEN_02_JESSE_10201: There must be a way to move that light.
D2_GEN_02_JESSE_10202: [0.03-4.14]Gotta move the train back to get the lights on.[5.86-7.01]Easy enough.
D2_GEN_02_JESSE_10203: [0.03-4.85]So the lights will only turn on when the train’s back in its dock.[7.11-7.67]Great.
D2_GEN_02_JESSE_10204: Hmm, looks like I have to move the train forward to get through.
D2_GEN_02_JESSE_10205: [0.44-1.72]This isn’t working.[2.83-5.48]Maybe the Cores aren’t plugged into the right machines?
D2_GEN_02_JESSE_10206: I didn’t think I’d find something worse than the Hiss in here.
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10184: [0.03-2.80]That doesn’t look like a House Shift.[4.42-5.85]Do I even want to know?
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10185: I guess they’re flying now.
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10186: OK, now that’s cool.
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10187: We can’t stay in the dark.
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10188: It’s not safe in the dark.
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10189: There’s gotta be a Power Core around here.
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10190: We need a Power Core.
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10191: We need another Power Core.
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10192: We need to get those lights on.
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10193: OK, now where’s the switch?
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10194: We need some light in here.
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10195: Let’s turn on the lights!
D2_GEN_03_JESSE_10196: I need a little light.

D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_1_10212: That’s a completely inaccurate description.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_1_10214: We’re letting you off with a warning, Mr. Langston.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_1_10216: Get out.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_1_10605: is indeed a Bureau offense, Mr. Langston,
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_1_10606: and can be prosecuted as such.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_1_10614: But this is going on your record, so one more screw up and our next chat won’t be so friendly.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_1_O.S.: 
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON: 
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10207: OK, this room is really intimidating and all, but I know my rights!
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10209: Uh, OK, well I didn’t know that.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10211: OK, uh, good.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10213: Whatever! Listen, I’m just a desk jockey.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10215: Great! That is just great to hear, guys.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10604: It’s not a crime to try and get a book signed.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10607: So yeah, I was just looking to fill out my Wake collection.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10608: I certainly didn’t know Hartman had turned into some kind of shadow zombie-
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10609: Yesterday, Dave Gleeson and his crew were talking to that empty spacesuit and laughing their heads off.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10610: I see people break the rules all the time and no one is pulling them into dark rooms to yell at them.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10611: I made one mistake!
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10612: Don’t come down on me like this.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10613: I sort papers, do data entry, that kind of stuff.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10615: Hey, is there any chance I could get my copy of “The Creator’s Dilemma” back?
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10616: Thank you, thank you so much.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10617: Listen, this is being blown way out of proportion.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10618: I thought it’d be cool to get a copy of “The Creator’s Dilemma” signed. Uh, that’s a book that Hartman wrote-
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_01_LANGSTON_10619: All that happened is I heard Dr. Hartman had been brought in and, since I’m a huge Alan Wake fan,

D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_02_BRIAN_10220: I do?
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_02_BRIAN_10222: The movie? I don’t, I mean, it wasn’t very good.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_02_BRIAN_10224: Movie Knight, with a, you know, a “k”, not an “n”. Not “night” like “night time” but-
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_02_BRIAN_10226: No one! I just did it because it looked obscure! I didn’t even like the movie!
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_02_BRIAN_10621: and maybe even go to college and get a film degree like I’ve always wanted to.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_02_BRIAN_10622: and I thought if I looked smart I would get listeners and my podcast would take off and I could move out of my parents’ basement
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_02_BRIAN_10623: I shouldn’t have given it such a high score, but reviewing obscure films makes you look smart

D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_FBC_INTERROGATOR_3_10626: Why’d you stow away on that ship?
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_FBC_INTERROGATOR_3_10627: What the hell do you want?
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_FBC_INTERROGATOR_3_10630: Just send this thing to the guys in research. Let them cut it up or whatever they do.
D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_03_FBC_INTERROGATOR_3_10631: Hear that? They’re gonna cut you up, you pain in the ass!

D2_OPCON_AUDIOLOG_04_FBC_INTERROGATOR_2_10249: Tell you what I CAN do.

<p>Asking us to interrogate these scum without using words like “Altered Items” or “AWEs” or “paracriminal” is the stupidest thing I’ve heard in my life and I‘ve heard some fucking stupid things. They already know the facts, hell, they know just as much as us, if not MORE. And they get to sit there laughing at us while we dance around our words, trying not to leak “classified terminology”. They already know the fucking terminology! </p>

<p>If you think pulling me off the case will stop me, then think again. That piece of shit blew up those tracks. He killed those people, all to make a train turn altered. We have him dead to rights and you need to let me back in that interrogation cell so I can get him to flip on his buddies. These people are terrorists and deserve to be treated as such. This won’t stop unless we stop them. </p>

d2_opcon_doc_ai_arcade_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p><b>SHÜM Arcade Cabinets (AI40-PE)</b></p>

<p><u>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:</u></p>

<p>A distance of 10 feet between the items suppresses their effect. Effect only triggers on physical contact.</p>

<p><u>DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:</u></p>

<p>Items are a pair of arcade game cabinets, originally designed for the games “SHÜM” (AI40:A) and “SHÜM 2: Culgar’s Revenge” (AI40:B). The games were manufactured by Bon-Co Entertainment, now out of business. Despite being a popular arcade game in Japan during the late 80s/early 90s, no other SHÜM cabinets have been found by our investigators.</p>

<p>When touching one of the items while it stands within 10 feet of its counterpart, the user’s mind is transported to a version of their subjective reality that resembles a video game in logic and function. Events from their everyday lives become game-like sequences in which speed and efficacy are paramount. The brain enters a stroke-like state (as proven by EEG studies on users) which only ends after the user “finishes” their game, at which point they resume normal brain and motor function.</p>

<p>Both items were purchased from a closing arcade in <em>REDACTED</em>, Michigan as part of a program to improve employee wellbeing through recreation. The program was cancelled before any game machines were dispersed throughout the Oldest House, but not before these Altered Items were discovered.</p>

<p><u>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</u><p>

<p>Teams in the Research Sector have voiced considerable interest in the items due to the fact that they only exhibit an altered effect when physically paired together, a codependent relationship previously unseen in Altered Items (see Research Specialist Pope’s paper titled “The Parasensitivity of Sequels” for more information).</p>

<p>However, after proving the items’ altered status, the Investigations staff insisted on keeping them, claiming that they are important for sector morale. To date, numerous petitions have been filed by Research Sector personnel to move the items there for more extensive analysis.</p>

<p><u>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:</u></p>

<p>Item is not in Bureau custody. None known.</p>

<p><u>DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:</u></p>

<p>A Frank Elk tractor. Olive green. Dried blood on the grill when last seen.</p>

<p>Item is capable of vocalized responses (or “growls”) and unmanned locomotion. Considered highly aggressive and dangerous.</p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>

<p>The item first came to the Bureau’s attention after the death of William Burrough, owner of Burrough Farm outside of Trenton, Texas. Local authorities arrived on scene after an employee found the mutilated body of Mr. Burrough beneath his tractor.</p>

<p>Police arrived, but were immediately driven away by the tractor. Panicked calls to federal authorities were intercepted by Bureau communications staff. A team was dispatched.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, the agents approached the item. It responded by “growling like a bear”. Three agents were injured when they tried to detain the item, which escaped. Aerial searches for the item are ongoing.</p>

<p>Speaking to Mrs. Burrough only revealed that she had a domestic altercation with Mr. Burrough earlier the night of the incident. Whether these events are connected is currently unknown.</p>

<p>[NOTE: Miscommunication led to a local coroner examining the body of William Burrough]</p>

<p>BURROUGH, WILLIAM - Male - Caucasian</p>

<p>CASE SUMMARY: 33-year-old man found dead on his property, per police report. Remains obtained for Coroner’s office also include blood, urine, bile, stomach contents, and bone fragments.</p>

<p>AUTOPSY FINDINGS:</p>

<p>Blunt force injuries - head: </p>

<p>a. Lacerations - left ear/cheek</p>

<p>Blunt force injuries - extremities: </p>

<p>a. Dislocation - right knee</p>

<p>b. Complete avulsion of the right upper extremity with associated fracture of the proximal right humerus</p>

<p>Extensive trauma - abdominal region:</p>

<p>a. Complete avulsion of multiple organs, including stomach, heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, and portions of the large and small intestine (all missing from scene)</p>

<p>CONCLUSION: It is my opinion that Mr. Burrough’s death is not the result of a mechanical accident, as claimed by authorities. The removal of organs is consistent with animal attack.</p>

<p><u>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE:</u></p>

<p>The item’s altered effect can be avoided by simply not entering it. Proper signage and barriers should provide sufficient containment.</p>

<p>The item is currently held in the Investigations Sector’s AWE West hangar for ongoing investigations.</p>

<p><u>DESCRIPTION/PARAUTILITY:</u></p>

<p>The item’s exterior is that of a standard CZ10 Vista Dome train car (the largest known Altered Item on record). Its interior seems to be an adjacent reality related to a trauma or memory belonging to a <em>REDACTED</em> and not the physical item’s own history.</p>

<p>Causation for this link is still to be determined, but possibilities include the outside interference possibly responsible for the item’s altered state or trauma imprinting via shared memory states.</p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>

<p>The item was discovered when the Bureau responded to a suspected crime scene in Bloomington, Illinois. The item was identified as an Altered Item and transported to the Bureau for examination and testing. See AWE-44 for further details.</p>

<p>None known. Testing in the Investigations Sector is currently ongoing.</p>

<p><u>DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT:</u></p>

<p>A vending machine, its front covered in a faux-wood panel. Coin-operated, buttons for selecting food products.</p>

<p>The item generates and stores a variety of material (both edible and otherwise) in its rows of internal trays. Initial testing suggests the item reacts to the mind of the individual in closest proximity and will produce whatever they subconsciously desire.</p>

<p>Attempts to cause the item to create a living <em>[REDACTED]</em> have consistently failed.</p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>

<p>The item was discovered in a nursing home in <em>REDACTED</em>, Alberta after a resident named Muriel <em>REDACTED</em> called a local news station about a “magic” vending machine. The news story reported that the nursing home’s staff was purposefully stocking the machine with distinctive food and objects as a way to raise residents’ spirits. The Bureau response team encouraged this story while confiscating the item.</p>

<p>The call resulted in Mrs. Wake being brought into the Oldest House for an in-person interview (for a full transcript, refer to file <em>[REDACT]</em>) on <em>[REDACTED]</em>, 2017. The excursion into the Oceanview Motel occurred later that same day.</p>

<p><u>CONCLUSION:</u></p>

<p>Determining whether this was a basic synchronicity event, if Alice Wake is responsible for its appearance, or if the door itself relates to AWE-35 is paramount. She should be returned to the Oldest House, possibly even taken into the Motel itself, to confirm if any other changes occur.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>SUBJECT: ALICE WAKE</b></p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>

<p>After reaching out to the Bureau, Alice Wake was brought into the Oldest House for an interview on <em>[REDACTED]</em>, 2017. See file <em>[REDACT]</em> for the full transcript.</p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The interview conducted by Agents Shah and Dempsey revealed that Mrs. Wake has had recurring nightly “visitations” from her missing ex-husband in her New York apartment (address: <em>[RED REDACTED RED]</em>. Mr. Wake “appears out of nowhere and rushes at [her] down the corridor”. According to her impression, he appears “crazy and horrifying”, clearly coming at her “with violent intent”. Mrs. Wake believes that he is “haunting” her, insisting he is “not Alan, but a fucking monster in his body”.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wake has not been sleeping out of the fear of these visits. Her attempts to keep the lights on through the night result in the relevant hallway’s lightbulb breaking every night (possibly indicating involvement of the <em>[REDACTED]</em>).</p>

<p>Further investigation required. We propose installing monitoring equipment in the apartment. Copies of supply request form L-501-4 have been sent to Mr. Kirklund and administration for approval.</p>

<p><u>DESCRIPTION:</u></p>

<p>A photograph of Alan Wake captured by Alice Wake during an event in her home.</p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>

<p>Alice Wake, former wife of Alan Wake (see AWE-35 for details), has recently been visited at night by her ex-husband (or entity resembling him, see file <em>[REDACTED]</em> for more). Being a professional photographer, Mrs. Wake positioned cameras with motion sensors around the corridor he appears in and managed to capture an image of Mr. Wake on film.</p>

<p><u>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</u></p>

<p>During an interview with Mrs. Wake, she mentioned that her favorite camera, a <em>[REDACTED]</em> model, was lost in 2010, during AWE-35. No match has been found among the confiscated evidence from AWE-35. It has been filed as a potential Altered Item and research staff stationed at Bright Falls are being contacted to check if they have any knowledge of such an item.</p>

<p><u>EVENT SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>An unconfirmed Threshold manifestation occurred at Cauldron Lake, WA.</p>

<p>The citizens of Bright Falls had gathered in the town’s southwestern fields for the annual festival known as Deerfest. Eyewitnesses all claim that the day had been sunny, confirmed by reviews of the area’s weather reports, but then, with no warning, a thunderstorm appeared in the direction of the Anderson Farm and a tornado rose from Cauldron Lake. The torrential rain that followed caused a flash flood.</p>

<p>“It was as if the day had turned to night.” –testimony from <em>[REDACTED RED]</em></p>

<p>Frank Breaker, the Sheriff of Bright Falls (formerly a Bureau Agent, see employee file <em>[REDACTED]</em>), managed to guide the crowd to safety as the festival grounds were destroyed by the flood. The festival was cancelled, ending one day early.</p> 

<p>Lack of official Bureau presence on the scene makes this event difficult to report as a confirmed AWE, though the similarity to other known events in the Bright Falls area lend credence to the accounts of the townspeople.</p>

<p><u>DETAILS:</u></p>

<p>On the day of the flooding, the rock band Old Gods of Asgard was rehearsing in a field outside the Anderson Farm, the homestead of band members Odin and Tor Anderson. Both admitted to being in a heavy state of inebriation at the time, having spent “days” drinking their home-brewed moonshine while celebrating Deerfest.</p>

<p>After the townspeople were evacuated from the flooded field, Sheriff Breaker was asked by Freya Anderson, daughter of Tor Anderson, to check on her father and uncle. Breaker drove to the Anderson Farm and found the band members alive but in need of medical aid. Tor Anderson had been struck by lightning and Odin Anderson had cut out his own right eye (a possible ref. to Norse deities <em>[REDA]</em> and <em>[REDA]</em>?). They claimed they had fought and “valiantly defeated” a “dark army of the scratching hag” rising from Cauldron Lake (see AWE-<em>[RE]</em> of 1970, related to the suspected <em>[REDACTEDRED]</em> at Diver’s Isle).</p>

<p>While impossible to verify, these events are relevant to the recurring AWE at Bright Falls and the Cauldron Lake <em>[REDACTED]</em>. Odin and Tor Anderson have been listed as persons of interest.</p>

<p><u>EVENT SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>A paranatural entity arrived on Earth by infiltrating the Apollo 14 lunar mission at an unknown point of their voyage to the Fra Mauro highlands of the Moon.</p>

<p><u>EVENT RESPONSE:</u></p>

<p>32 hours after the return of the Apollo 14 command module to Earth, the Bureau was contacted by Mr. <em>REDACTED</em>, a White House senior official, and instructed to send a small team to the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>

<p>At the base, the team examined the entity and carried out interviews with NASA staff. They learned that four astronauts had returned to Earth instead of the expected three. Each human crewmember was insistent that the mission left with four members, though they couldn’t name the fourth when asked. The entity seemingly affected their memory to make its presence feel unremarkable.</p>

<p>The entity was transported to the Oldest House for further investigation.</p>

<p>NOTE: An altercation between NASA security and the investigation team occurred upon their arrival. Mr. <em>REDACTED</em> called to clarify the matter, though tensions remained high. Bureau jurisdiction and clearance should be defined more clearly with other federal agencies.</p>

<p><u>DETAILS:</u></p>

<p>The Apollo 14 entity (commonly known as “Fra”) underwent a series of physical examinations upon its admittance into the Oldest House.</p>

<p>The entity can speak, though its poor grasp of the English language makes any meaningful communication impossible. Interview material can be found at <em>REDACTED</em>.</p>

<p>Its physical form consists solely of the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) spacesuit used by NASA astronauts, the same model worn by the other crew. This could be an authentic EMU taken from one of the NASA astronauts (though this suit does not bear any wearer’s name) or one materialized through <em>REDACTED</em> conversion or possibly <em>REDACTED</em> corporealization. The suit itself is slightly damaged, which is likely due to the fact that the command module did not have a fourth seat for the entity to strap into during re-entry.</p>

<p>The EMU is entirely hollow and pieces can be removed, though this seems to agitate the entity. X-rays and spectrograph imaging have shown <em>[REDACTED]</em>-shaped outlines existing within the suit. For safety reasons, the entity will be contained in a secure cell until more information can be gathered.</p>

<p><u>EVENT SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>A train derailment resulting in 62 casualties and numerous injuries was suspected to have been the work of a paracriminal group known as <em>REDACTED</em>. As a result of this event, the agents discovered that one of the cars had become altered with a persistent auditory event. It remains to be determined whether the AWE was spontaneous or the direct result of the sabotage.</p>

<p><u>EVENT RESPONSE:</u></p>

<p>The Bureau had been tracking said group at the time and the intel gathered suggested an event of this caliber was imminent in Bloomington. As a result, a response team on site was able to respond to the train accident site within minutes of its occurrence. They arrived to find emergency processes underway, but also equipment left behind by the suspected group. A suspicious onlooker managed to elude agents after they attempted to make contact.</p>

<p>Further investigation of the accident site revealed a curiously undamaged train car that exhibited an altered state when entered. This individual car was secured and transported to the Investigations Sector for further studies.</p>

<p>The Bureau has gathered concrete evidence that the train derailment was in fact the work of the paracriminal group known as <em>REDACTED</em>, which, according to the Bureau’s intel, has shown a concerning interest in experimenting with the artificial manufacturing of altered materials.</p>

<p>Knowing the group largely operates in the American Midwest, the Bureau worked alongside the FBI to ascertain their movements and rendezvous locations. This cooperation provided agents with information that led to an arrest in conjunction with the AWE case. Under suspicion of involvement, <em>REDACTED</em> was brought in for questioning.</p>

<p>An interrogation performed by Agent <em>Hewitt</em> resulted in the suspect being kept in a holding cell for two days without food, in breach of the Paracriminal Rights Act. Afterwards, the suspect confessed to his involvement in the <em>REDACTED</em> group and provided information on other members in exchange for his freedom.</p>

<p>A black-market hub specializing in the trade of occult talismans, relics, and other assorted ceremonial objects, as well genuine altered and paranatural materials was raided in <em>[REDACTED]</em>, Czech Republic by a team of special investigators. Unsuccessful attempts by suspects to escape using Altered Items resulted in numerous casualties and prevented the Bureau from questioning all participants.</p>

<p>The following interrogations revealed that not only is there a vast network of these retailers, but that they seem to be gathering information on Altered Items and other paranatural materials from sources unknown to the Bureau.</p>

<p>The Bureau’s concern here is three-fold:</p>

<p>a) There is a growing underground market for paranatural materials, which implies a growing awareness of their existence among a niche group of the general public</p>

<p>b) These criminal individuals do not seem aware of the items’ paranatural powers and their attempts to activate them could prove devastating if done in populated areas</p>

<p>This group/individual has operated outside of the Bureau’s notice for decades, perhaps longer, displaying a level of skill and caution rarely seen in paracriminal groups. A review of past cases has found various mentions of their activity over the years.</p>

<p>In 1988, a business called Blessed Repair and Service was suspected of involvement with an Object of Power case, perhaps even creating it.</p>

<p>None of these businesses or individuals have ever been located. However, their connection to appearances of Altered Items and Objects of Power is too direct to be considered circumstantial.</p>

<p>A request came through recently from an FBI agent asking for all our files on Bright Falls, specifically on the disappearance of the author, Alan Wake. Per the Inter-agency Information Exchange Agreement, I had some paper-pushers gather up a folder of all the pre-approved files.

<p>But I’m writing to let you know that we received this request from a special agent named Alex Casey. Sounds familiar, right? That’s because Alex Casey is the name of the fictional detective in those hardboiled crime books Alan Wake wrote. Pretty interesting that an FBI agent sharing a name with the most famous character Wake wrote is looking into a case dealing with a writer’s fiction coming true.

<p>Paranatural entity A-010 (a.k.a. the Shadow) is an aggressive <em>[REDACT]</em> consisting of three known types.</p>

<p>Type A: Localized manifestations of sentient <em>[REDACT]</em>, capable of occupying organic and inorganic material, as well as exerting <em>[REDACTEDRED]</em> over its surroundings.</p>

<p>Type B: Shaded Individuals – Human bodies <em>[REDACTED]</em> by the Shadow. These individuals become notably more aggressive but do seem to retain <em>[REDACTED]</em> of their previous selves. Research is ongoing as to whether this condition is reversible.</p>

<p>Type C: Shaded Objects – Similar to Type B, except that inanimate objects are <em>[REDACTED]</em> solely to be used as destructive tools.</p>

<p>Each type seems to work towards a shared goal, possibly targeting certain individuals (see AWE-35), which may imply a shared link to a <em>[REDACTED]</em> intelligence.</p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Per authorization from Mr. Kirklund, internal investigation D-084-5 was launched into the ethical practices of Dr. Casper Darling, Head of Research.</p>

<p>Despite the accounts of anonymous <em>[REDACTED]</em> regarding inhumane treatment of a <em>[REDACTEDRED]</em> currently housed in the Bureau, our official findings regarding this were inconclusive.</p>

<p>Numerous obstacles arose during this investigation. The majority of <em>[REDACTED]</em> Sector personnel seem to be wholly unaware of any such <em>[REDACT]</em> contained there. One <em>[REDACTED]</em> confirmed the <em>[REDACT]</em>’s codename to be <em>[REDACTED]</em>, but all files pertaining to that name were inaccessible, being classified under the highest clearance level. Investigators were similarly blocked from entering the <em>[REDACTEDRED]</em> Research wing to interview its staff. The matter was further complicated by the lack of clarity on whether non-human paranatural entities warrant “humane” treatment.</p>

<p>While this investigation cannot address any charges against Dr. Darling, we do recommend an investigation into <em>[REDACTEDRED]</em> Research.</p>

<p>To Chief Investigator Denis,</p>

<p>It happened again. Third time this year. Something certainly has it out for our <em>[REDACTED]</em>. Could be raccoons, the locals certainly complain about them enough, but why the hell would raccoons keep going after a monitoring station? Doesn’t add up. Anyway, I’ve got a Bureau tech going to the site next week to take a look.</p>

<p>Next on the list of recurring problems is the staff at the Lake House research station. How am I supposed to effectively keep an eye on <em>[REDACTED]</em> Lake if they won’t let me see any data? Hell, I don’t even know <u>what</u> they’re researching out there. We need to petition them again to share their info with Investigations agents. It’s only a matter of time before this <em>[RED]</em> hits again and I want to be prepared.</p>

<p>Anyway, if anyone at HQ asks why the Bright Falls report is a little thin this month, tell them it’s because we couldn’t take any readings. In the meantime, I might invest in some raccoon traps. </p></p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>RE: INCIDENT #A-49</b></p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--INTERNAL / CONFIDENTIAL --</b></p> 

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The purpose of internal investigation X-039-7 is to examine the containment failure of specimen SI-1 that resulted in the deaths of <em>[32]</em> agents.</p>

<p>An inspection report of the containment equipment three days earlier showed no faults. Investigators suspect human error to be the cause, yet no department has provided any evidence to support this.</p>

<p>Technicians were able to recover the researcher’s notes on the specimen from the internal network. On the <em>[RED]</em> of <em>[ACTED]</em>, the specimen began displaying a sharp increase in aggressive <em>[REDACTED]</em>. Cross-referencing that date with various logs found only two events inconsistent with the sector’s daily routine. 1) The air filters were changed, and 2) an hour prior to the incident, a civilian named Alice <em>[WAKE]</em> entered the sector regarding an unrelated investigation (see interview #65-F-124).</p>

<p>Given their connection to the same AWE case, it is likely that Mrs. <em>[WAKE]</em>’s presence is relevant to the specimen’s escape and to the <em>[REDACTED]</em>. Investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>RE: SHADED SPECIMEN A-010, FORMERLY DR. EMIL HARTMAN</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>An alert from the <em>[REDACTED]</em>, WA monitoring station indicated minor <em>[RED]</em> activity occurring in the area. Agent Estevez was dispatched to investigate. Inside the <em>[REDACTEDRED]</em> Lodge, she discovered the facility’s former owner, Dr. Emil Hartman. He had been converted into a Shaded Individual (per definitions found in file 6-34-1923) and displayed violent behavior characteristic of its type.</p>

<p>Agent Estevez alerted the on-site research team to the specimen’s presence and, with some difficulty, it was successfully contained in a Black Rock cell. The cell and its inhabitant were transported safely back to HQ, where the specimen remains detained in the <em>[REDACTEDRE]</em> Sector as part of the <em>[REDACTEDREDA]</em> AWE investigation.</p>

<p>Once the investigation is closed, research teams have petitioned to relocate this specimen to their sector for study.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>RE: DR. EMIL HARTMAN</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Dr. Emil Hartman is an academic psychotherapist that owned and operated a recovery center in <em>[REDACTEDRED]</em>, WA focused on the treatment of artists struggling with creative blocks and other mental disorders.</p>

<p>Publicly, Dr. Hartman’s treatment center seemed unremarkable in its methods and purpose. Privately, however, Dr. Hartman was abusing his patients in order to utilize any latent <em>[REDACTEDRED]</em> abilities they may possess with the aim of shaping <em>[REDACTED]</em> to his own benefit, which has earned him a Class 2 Paracriminal designation. (NOTE: For more on the link between artists and their ability to <em>[REDACTED]</em> reality through artistic mediums, see file <em>[REDACTED]</em>).</p>

<p>Investigation has proven that Dr. Hartman’s illegal endeavors were conducted alone. After being approached by the Bureau during the <em>[REDACTED]</em> investigation, he displayed no remorse or intention to cease his actions. Dr. Hartman was taken into custody, evaluated, and released <em>[R]</em> months later, having been deemed a negligible threat. His medical license has been permanently revoked.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>DR. EMIL HARTMAN (SHADED)</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Dr. Hartman is the first Type 2 Shaded Individual to be examined alive by the Bureau and has proven a valuable asset for our understanding of A-010, a.k.a. the Shadow.</p>

<p>Like all Shaded Individuals, the specimen is constantly shielded by (or produces?) a <em>[REDACT]</em> of darkness that makes visual observation difficult. This <em>[REDACT]</em> also protects the specimen from harm. During testing, non-lethal ballistics proved ineffective against it.</p>

<p>The specimen uses words and phrases that seem to originate from its previous life as a therapist. Some phrases have even been identified as quotes from Dr. Hartman’s book “The Creator’s Dilemma”. This seems to indicate the host’s personality remains <em>[REDACTED]</em>, to some degree.</p>

<p>For research purposes, Shaded Hartman was relocated to the Cauldron Lake Lodge replica built for the <em>[REDACTEDRED]</em> AWE investigation. Researchers hope a familiar setting may trigger new behavior. This experiment has yielded no results thus far.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>-- CONFIDENTIAL --</b></p>

<p>SUMMARY:</p>

<p>This subgroup of Hiss-corrupted Rangers has manifested the ability to levitate, similarly to Hiss Elevated Agents. However, these airborne Hiss Rangers display no telekinetic abilities and simply continue to use mundane Bureau weaponry.</p>

<p>This evolution, being so similar to the Elevated, possibly indicates that Hiss can “share” permutations through a type of network or perhaps osmosis. However, the fact that this development in Hiss Rangers has only been observed in the Investigations Sector may indicate that an environmental factor is responsible. They could be responding to an Altered Item or other paranatural element found only in that sector. Or perhaps this is the natural progression of the Hiss Ranger phenotype. Not enough time has passed to determine a conclusive trajectory of development for each of the Hiss manifestations, assuming any such trajectory exists.</p>

<p>We stopped at Keystone on our way to the target AWE, like you asked. I’m sending my report directly to you, to try and keep a lid on this Gruman/Morales desertion issue.</p>

<p>We didn’t find any sign of them here. Given their records, it is possible they’ve switched teams, like you suspected, but I don’t think that’s the case. An event definitely occurred here in Keystone and I think Gruman and Morales got caught up in it. The entire population has vanished into thin air. Reminds me of the Ordinary case, but that was just the adults if I’m remembering the file correctly. This is different. I think our guys are casualties, not traitors.</p>

<p>If it was an AWE, it seems to be over. We walked through the whole town and the only strange thing we noticed were markings on various buildings. Two overlapping circles, with a dot in the shared space. Could be unrelated. I’ll show you the pictures when I get back.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you should send a team out here to cordon this place off and maybe get the comms guys working on a cover story.</p>

<p><u>REVIEW</u></p>

<p>Agent Samuel Turnbull committed a misdemeanor while performing his duties as supervising agent of Project <em>REDACTED</em>, designed to help undercover agents re-assimilate to office duties.</p>

<p>The incident began when Agent Turnbull refused one of the operatives entry into the Oldest House, claiming that they had been compromised. The situation escalated as Agent Turnbull attempted to “force a confession out of the bastard”. The injuries inflicted upon the victim required a trip to the Medical Wing.</p>

<p>Agent Turnbull denied any guilt, maintaining that the victim was “some sort of pod person” and that he, unlike his colleagues, could see their true intentions; to use the Bureau’s connections to climb the ranks of government and eventually into the Oval Office.</p>

<p><u>ACTION TAKEN</u></p>

<p>Despite breaching Bureau offense code 45, Agent Turnbull was given leave of absence with full pay due to his sterling record. He will be required to undergo a psychological evaluation upon his return.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>RE: NASA</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Following the NASA/FBC Coordination Agreement of 1972, the Bureau has provided NASA with numerous technological advancements based on our research, including the Black Rock lining now found in all space-faring vessels. In return, all data gathered during space missions is made available for Bureau researchers to analyze.</p>

<p>Recently, certain individuals have raised the concern that this relationship does not adequately benefit the Bureau, either intellectually or financially. A thorough examination of the costs accrued by both organizations has shown that the expense of NASA’s recent launch of the <em>[REDACTED]</em> far outweighs any spending related to the processing and delivery of Black Rock. From its Medium Earth Orbit, the <em>[REDACTED]</em> will provide the Bureau with an unparalleled resource for remotely monitoring and photographing AWE sites, a resource that would be lost if the partnership ends.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of this committee that maintaining a cooperative relationship with our colleagues at NASA is of vital importance.</p>

<p align=CENTER>DIRECTOR</p>

<p align=CENTER>You are mine now, creature. I will return you to my facility and control your power!</p>

<p align=CENTER>SCIENTIST</p>

<p align=CENTER>Sir, we don’t know--</p>

<p>The Entity instead rushes forward and engulfs the Director. He SCREAMS in pain as the Scientist looks on and does nothing, like the coward that he is.</p>

<p align=CENTER>ENTITY (subtitled)</p>

<p align=CENTER>I am not the one being examined. I am not the one locked inside a prison.</p>

<p>Gradually, the Director emerges from the entity. His once sparkling eyes are now empty and dull. The Scientist rushes to him.</p>

<p align=CENTER>SCIENTIST</p>

<p align=CENTER>Sir, sir? We have to escape!</p>

<p align=CENTER>DIRECTOR</p>

<p align=CENTER>We cannot. They are in control now. I got what I wanted.</p>

d2_opcon_doc_nightsprings_04_DESCRIPTION1: <p>The Scientist turns from what used to be his Director, now transformed into a stranger, an alien that only resembles the Director in form. </p>

<p>He drops his all-important clipboard as he stumbles towards the closing portal, but the horrible Entity is already rushing through it in a flow of INSANITY and CHAOS. The Scientist becomes caught in it and the Entity devours him, screaming, as it enters our world. The Director lifts his pistol to his head. His hand is steady, sure in its finality.</p>

<p align=CENTER>DIRECTOR</p>

<p align=CENTER>Or so I thought.</p>

<p>Camera fades to black. A GUNSHOT is heard.</p>

<p align=CENTER>NARRATOR (V.O.)</p>

<p align=CENTER>And so, our hunger for control, our obsession for domination and power, the hubris at play in this children’s puppet show we’re starring in can only lead to our fall from control, to submit to those who really hold the strings and control us… in Night Springs.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>RE: THE PRIME CANDIDATE PROGRAM</b></p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--INTERNAL / CONFIDENTIAL --</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Per authorization from Mr. Kirklund, internal investigation P-142-9 was launched into the legality of the Prime Candidate Program <em>[REDACTED]</em> by the Federal Bureau of Control.</p>

<p>Since all known subjects relevant to the investigation used executive privilege to decline interviews, very little firsthand information was gathered. However, anonymous sources and documentation declassified by Mr. Kirklund both paint an alarmingly clear picture of systematic <em>[REDACTED]</em> and <em>[REDACTED]</em>. <em>[REDACTED]</em> were brought into the Oldest House and placed under <em>[REDACTED]</em> examination and testing with the aim of appointing one as Director upon maturity. This program has produced no successful cases and only resulted in the traumatic <em>[REDACTED]</em> of paranaturally-inclined <em>[REDACTED]</em>. Not only is this in breach of the Ash Act, but it flies in the face of basic human <em>[REDACATED]</em>.</p>

<p>This investigation team unequivocally <em>[REDCATED]</em> the Prime Candidate Program and recommends that it be <em>[REDACTED]</em> immediately.</p>

<p>Kirklund,</p>

<p>I am growing tired of your blatant attempts to lay your incompetence at my doorstep. I know you want this to be true, but you are Head of Investigations. This failure is your responsibility.</p>

<p>What did you think would happen, holding a dangerous specimen in Investigations? The Containment Sector exists for a reason. They are better trained and better equipped for this type of work. In fact, they have admirably taken on certain AWE monitoring responsibilities that your staff are no longer capable of. This happens more and more now.</p>

<p>And don’t think your petty internal investigations have gone past my notice. You are a worm! Everything I’ve done has been for the benefit of the Bureau. The Prime Candidate Program only failed because of Darling. You are both failures, plotting against me! You are traitors, but the truth will emerge out of you!</p>

<p>You are choosing to become my enemy, Kirklund. You don’t want to be.</p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Per authorization from Mr. Kirklund, <em>[REDACTRED REDACTED</em> <em>RE]-[DAC]-[T]</em> was launched into the <em>[REDACTED]</em> of Director Zachariah Trench.</p>

<p>A recent change in <em>[REDACTED]</em> witnessed in Director Trench, including aggressive <em>[REDACTED]</em> when <em>[REDACTEDED]</em> with other staff has been observed. However, this investigation is aimed at interpreting this issue rather than proving it.</p>

<p>Notable <em>[REDACTED]</em> between Director Trench and Dr. Darling has been witnessed by numerous Bureau staff. Although both declined to meet for an interview on the matter, witness accounts suggest their arguments center around the Dimensional Research wing and the <em>[REDACTED]</em> kept inside. However, no evidence exists to confirm Director Trench’s <em>[REDACTED]</em> as anything more than interpersonal disagreements.</p>

<p>This investigation has concluded that Director Trench’s behavior is not indicative of any <em>[REDACTED]</em> and that his fitness to lead is not in question.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>RE: DR. RAYA UNDERHILL</b></p>

<p>SUMMARY:</p>

<p>Dr. Raya Underhill is a professor at the University of Woodrow in the United Kingdom, where she teaches biology with a focus on botany. Dr. Underhill once worked with the Bureau as a parabotanist stationed in the Research Sector of the Oldest House. She served with no incidents or demerits and is praised by those who formerly worked with her, including Dr. Darling.</p>

<p>Dr. Underhill has no known connections to paracriminal organizations or any record of breaching her NDAs since leaving the Bureau. Her civilian behavior has been ideal, with the exception of an ongoing personal relationship with Dr. Darling that appears to have begun during their time as co-workers in the Research Sector and revisited intermittently ever since. Depending on the duration of her work in the Oldest House, it may be required to have both parties sign a relationship clearance form.</p>

<p>This investigation has found no compelling reason to deny Dr. Darling’s request to offer Dr. Underhill an interim position with the aim of finding a solution to the Mold Threshold issue.</p>

d2_opcon_doc_understaffed_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p>Mr. Denis,</p>

<p>So yes, there’s an increase in AWE cases and yes, it would be a good idea to put together a special Task Force to examine exactly why that is. However, it seems that a tiny little detail has slipped through the cracks. We don’t have the damn staff!</p>

<p>If you expect us to detect, investigate, and process more AWE cases, you need to give us more people! It’s simple math. Between the staff we lost in the Hartman thing and the ones who left for other departments after Kirklund quit, we’re barely managing to keep up with the workload. Hell, just filing the paperwork for all the Altered Items we left behind in the sector has been an ordeal.</p>

<p>Another thing, and this is going to sound paradoxical, but we have an overcrowding situation. This lobby isn’t meant to accommodate a whole sector’s worth of staff. We put forward a motion to move Investigations to a more suitable location months ago. It better not still be sitting on your desk. The people are getting restless and, as Kirklund’s interim replacement, it’s your job to handle it.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_4_10278: Thank you for meeting with us again, Dr. Hartman.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_4_10280: It’s been invaluable, doctor, really.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_4_10282: We did have one question though.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_4_10284: Thank you, doctor, that’s all we need to hear. Remy?
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_4_10718: We have a much clearer picture of this event thanks to your accounts.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_4_10720: It’d be very helpful if you could fill us in on the details there.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_4_10721: and I’m paraphrasing here, unnatural abilities that you in fact encouraged during their time in your Lodge.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_FBC_INTERROGATOR_4_10722: You mentioned in an earlier conversation that your patients displayed,

D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_HARTMAN_10283: Of course.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_HARTMAN_10286: What? You can’t do this.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_HARTMAN_10288: That’s preposterous!
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_HARTMAN_10290: You’re making a mistake!
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_HARTMAN_10717: I hope the information I’ve provided thus far has been of some small use.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_HARTMAN_10723: My patients’ wellbeing was paramount, of course,
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_HARTMAN_10724: As I stated in my written proposal,
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_HARTMAN_10725: but I would hardly be a man of science if I did not reach out at the underlying truth.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_HARTMAN_10726: Like yourselves, I work to understand and even bend the rules of our earthly paradigm.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_01_HARTMAN_10730: Sharing notes, as they say.

D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10292: Though I believe now that it was for the best.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10293: I have a history of seeking such partnerships.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10294: And this is where my work turns... hypothetical.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10295: I anticipate Wake will similarly return one day.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10296: From this, I have concluded that the Lake, and the Dark Place within it,
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10297: All that remains is the dive itself.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10741: I am continuing my work, alone again,
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10742: Despite my generous offers, the conversations came to naught.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10743: since certain parties were too blind to recognize a golden opportunity.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10744: Some people simply do not value collaboration as I do.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10745: under the shackles of bureaucracy and regulation.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10746: The sort of bold, pioneering work that I am undertaking cannot thrive
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10747: There was a time when I had hoped Alan Wake and I could collaborate.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10748: But Wake was stubborn, egotistical.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10749: Together, we could have produced art such that the world has never seen.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10751: But, now, like Tom before him, Wake has disappeared into Cauldron Lake.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10752: Disappointing, nonetheless.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10753: Writers usually are.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10754: This indicates to me that the individuals within the Lake are not entirely “gone”.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10755: Since he was lost to the Lake, Thomas Zane has been observed by various townspeople.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10756: While I may harbor some resentment for the man, his raw talent and determination are undeniable.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10757: are not as removed from this world as I previously thought.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10758: I believe myself much more prepared than either Tom or Wake.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10759: Given my acute awareness of what awaits within, my meticulous preparations, and my considerable education,
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10760: I should be able to cross into that dark realm with the chance to return, as they have.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10761: It frightens me, I admit, but such is the burden of the truth-seeker.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10763: Until I return.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10764: It is time for a breakthrough.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_10765: I will take my plunge into the dark tomorrow, with only the light of knowledge to guide me.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_02_HARTMAN_O.S.: 
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN: 
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10298: My understanding of the Darkness is fragmented, incomplete.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10299: And given this conflict of natures, we know that the light of truth will burn away the darkness,
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10300: And then there are the artists.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10301: With Wake now secure in my Lodge, I expect I shall grow closer
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10766: This abyss, this void, it very much does not wish to be understood.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10767: We are opposing forces, destined to collide.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10768: Of course, my own nature drives me to comprehend all.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10769: By its very nature, it abhors comprehension. 
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10770: If light symbolizes knowledge, then it stands to reason that darkness would equate to ignorance.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10771: both figuratively and literally.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10772: against this metaphysical gloom.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10773: Any significant light source can be used as protection, even weaponry,
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10774: I know for a fact that Tom, Wake, the Anderson brothers,
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10776:  or did their work perhaps even create it?
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10777: The question is whether their uncanny ability to affect reality through their art beckons the Darkness,
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10778: and Lane all had some involvement with the Darkness.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10779: Well, perseverance is the foundation of knowledge.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10780: to learning the answers to these questions.
D2_OPCON_HARTMAN_03_HARTMAN_10781: Speaking of, I must be off on my rounds.

D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10794: The force at play here.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10795: Faden didn’t like that.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10796: Trying to make her act.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10797: And made weak because of the distance.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10798: It was powerful but it was coming from far away.

D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10800: Her guide felt it too.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10801: Subtle.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10802: It was changing things around her.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10803: Not a hostile transmission.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10804: So it wasn’t all bad.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10805: Faden sensed a drowning man.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10806: It was this, more than the man’s despair, that made her follow the call. 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10807: She knew that desperate acts can have grim consequences.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10808: She sensed something else too.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10809: A man desperate to escape.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10810: Waiting.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10811: Not unlike the hostile resonance.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10812: A hunger in the dark.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10813: There was a new button on the elevator control panel: “Investigations Sector.”
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10814: The elevator doors slid shut with practiced bravado.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10815: Faden pressed the button.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_10816: The darkness receded like a memory.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_01_WAKE_V.O.: 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE: 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10307: Doctor Emil Hartman was desperate.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10308: Emerging from the lake, the Thing was captured by the FBC.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10309: Then something else came.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10310: The darkness inside the Thing could’ve been immune.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10311: A metamorphosis followed.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10817: This was his last chance, his final experiment, what he’d been too scared to do before.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10818: Was taken.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10819: Hartman dove into the lake.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10820: The Federal Bureau of Control had stolen his life’s work.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10821: Violent, bloodthirsty darkness in the driver’s seat.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10822: Fragmented impulses on autoplay.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10823: Only an echo of him remained.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10824:  Became the Thing-that-Had-Been-Hartman.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10825: Devoured by hungry darkness.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10826: Brought in.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10827: Killed everyone it could.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10828: The Thing broke loose.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10829: Studied.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10830: Contained.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10831: Waiting.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10832: Roaming.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10833: Lurking.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10834: The Thing was alone in the dark.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10835: and sealed the sector.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10836: The FBC fell back
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10837: Not darkness.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10838: If there’s one, why not another.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10839: But similar enough.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10840: It shouldn’t be a surprise.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10841: A resonance.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10842: A sound.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10843: Fought.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10844: Could have resisted.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10845: But weaker with no link to its source. 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10846: It was timeless.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10847: Not aged.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10848: Maybe it had grown weaker over time.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10849: But it didn’t and it wasn’t.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10850: Could’ve been passed by, passed through, with no effect.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_10851: The Thing-that-Had-Been-Hartman went through another change.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_02_WAKE_V.O.: 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE: 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10312: The resonance carves its way through the Thing-that-Had-Been-Hartman.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10313: The Third Thing.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10314: The Third Thing said: “When you hear this you will know you’re in new you.”
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10315: The Third Thing was a monster.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10852: Vibrating.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10853: The sound changes the darkness.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10854: Remolding.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10855: The darkness changes the sound.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10856: A third thing. 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10857: They all turned into something else.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10858: They both changed what remained of Hartman.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10859: The sound made darker.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10860: Hartman was stretched.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10861: The darkness made louder.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10862: To the bottom, the heart, and through to the other side.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10863: Twisting inward, tightening, taking you deeper and deeper.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10864: The gravity well of a black hole.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10865: A maelstrom.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10866: A spiral.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10867: Almost an ouroboros.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10868: Like a worm through time.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10869: Stretched as anyone when seen from out of time.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10870: He said: “We build you till nothing remains.”
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10871: He said: ”Baby baby baby yeah. Orange peel.”
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10872: He said: “Under the conceptual reality behind this reality you must want these waves to drag you away.”
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10873: He’d tear apart any ordinary person crossing his path.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10874: There was nothing ordinary about Faden.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_10875: Now he crashed out of darkness toward Faden.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_03_WAKE_V.O.: 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE: 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10316: The story needed many beginnings.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10317: The more springs, the more the story became real.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10318: Wake felt the pressure grow in his head.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10319: Wake needed a hero.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10320: Wake channeled Burroughs and Bowie.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10876: The connections he had.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10877: His wife.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10878: The people.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10879: Wake used the materials he had.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10880: This was one.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10881: Streams that turned into a river, a flood, and then, an ocean.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10882: Many springs.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10883: Wake put them in to make it true.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10884: The places.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10886: Broke loose. 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10887: Went berserk.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10888: Sensed Wake through her.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10889: The Thing-that-Had-Been-Hartman sensed her near.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10890: She’d been in the Dark Place.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10891: Alice was a conduit.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10892: These connections, like magnets, moved things.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10893: His city.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10894: The psychiatrist.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10895: Wake made sure Alice was already gone by then.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10896: Safe.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10897: The more people believed.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10898: Where there was a connection already.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10899: Cause and effect.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10900: Where success was most likely.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10901: It had to go through the path of least resistance.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10902: It was extremely delicate and hard work.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10903: Going mad.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10904: He wanted to make it true. 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10905: He was already out.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10906: Write his escape.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10907: Wake had to escape.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10908: A hero needed a crisis.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10910: Something that can’t be translated, translated.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10911: Something to convey an alien force mimicking human intelligence.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10912: For the part in the story about the government agency, Wake needed something special.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10913: He cut up sentences and words.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10914: He put them in a shoebox.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10915: “Orange peel.” “You are home.” “Insane.”
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10916: Or had he tried this before?
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10917: He’d try anything once.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10918: Wake created a Dadaist poem.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_04_WAKE_10919: He pulled out the words.

D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10920: Deconstructed.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10921: Experimented with different voices.

D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10925: Relearned the language.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10926: Forgotten the language.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10927: Changed myself.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10928: Changed the style.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10929: Gone down this path before?
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10930: You must know where you’ve been to know where you’re going.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10931: The darkness wants to hide the past to make me lose my way.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10932: I wrote them for a reason.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10933: The only way to make progress.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10934: My notes to myself.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10935: Then write more.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10936: Recap.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10937: Ugly.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10938: Present.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10939: Functional.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10940: Make it clear.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10941: Rewrite it.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10942: Tear it apart.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10943: Cut through the reality.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10944: Only the brutal truth.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10945: Be blunt.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10946: They are drawn to the mystery.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10947: Make them do the work.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10948: Incept.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10949: You just imply.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10950: And they believe in it, because it's theirs now.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10951: And there’s only one, because you give them no choice.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10952: Their interpretation.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10953: You set it up, they put it together.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10954: Obsessed.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10955: They make it.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_05_WAKE_10956: Form the image in their minds.

D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE: 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10361: The Valhalla Nursing Home.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10362: Built after the Return comeback tour.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10363: Wheeler had managed to coax a couple of hit songs out of them before that.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10364: The old men rocked like they were possessed by the devil.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10365: The Andersons were so old.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10366: After the third gig, Wheeler couldn’t take it anymore.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10367: After the Old Gods comeback tour was cancelled,
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10957: For their twilight years. 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10958: Founded in 2014 for Odin and Tor Anderson of the Old Gods of Asgard fame.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10959: Cut short.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10960: To the chagrin of their agent Barry Wheeler. 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10961: Cancelled.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10962: Flip-flopped to be their farewell tour.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10963: Balance Slays the Demon.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10964: Three massive stadium-sized gigs.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10965: A couple of others.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10966: The backstage parties got out of hand.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10967: Like their namesakes.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10968: They ran off after every gig. 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10969: A rock ’n’ roll cliché.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10970: Booze and drugs.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10971: His migraine flared.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10972: Wheeler squinted.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10973: The air was thick with smoke.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10974: Wheeler had security track them down to the craziest afterparties.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10975: Vampires.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10976: It was that bad.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10977: Each time, Wheeler expected them to croak.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10978: And they never did completely.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10979: After every gig and the rampaging party that followed it took them weeks to bounce back.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10980: Princes of fucking Darkness.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10981: Wheeler cancelled.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10982: It was over. 
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10983: Called it off.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10984: Couldn’t stomach the idea of another client dropping dead on him.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10985: Wheeler set up a foundation with the money from the record sales of the Greatest Hits album and the gigs.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10986: The old men deserved it.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10987: Wheeler set up the nursing home facility.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10988: Wheeler was good at his job.
D2_OPCON_HOTLINE_06_WAKE_10989: A lot of money.

D2M01_07_JESSE_9878: [0.31-1.05]Shit![1.68-2.42]Now what?
D2M01_07_JESSE_9879: Uhhh...
D2M01_07_JESSE_9883: [0.03-2.28]Come on, elevator. Time to go.
D2M01_07_JESSE_9885: Fuck fuck fuck.
D2M01_07_JESSE_9886: [0.03-2.98]So you don’t like light... [3.05-4.33]I can use that.
D2M01_07_THE_THIRD_THING_9880: Hartman was stretched!
D2M01_07_THE_THIRD_THING_9882: Devoured by hungry darkness!
D2M01_07_THE_THIRD_THING_9884: Doctor Emil Hartman was desperate.
D2M01_08_JESSE_9887: Let’s, uh, stay in the light.
D2M01_08_JESSE_9888: [0.04-0.67]Ugh.[1.44-3.08]I don’t feel right.[4.82-7.88]Something in this darkness is draining me.
D2M01_08_JESSE_9889: [0.03-0.69]Shit![1.23-3.02]Nothing even touches it.
D2M01_08_JESSE_9890: Gotta get the lights on!
D2M01_08_JESSE_9891: There we go!
D2M01_08_JESSE_9892: [0.00-0.51]Yeah![0.68-1.82]How do you like that?
D2M01_09_JESSE_9894: [0.00-0.67]Jesus![0.71-3.13]Don’t scare me like that, Langston.
D2M01_09_JESSE_9896: Langston? It’s me, Jesse.
D2M01_09_JESSE_9898: Let me guess: you sealed it because of the monster guy? 
D2M01_09_JESSE_9900: That thing is a person?
D2M01_09_JESSE_9902: No.
D2M01_09_JESSE_9904: I don’t have any of those, Langston.
D2M01_09_JESSE_9907: Maybe from where you’re standing.
D2M01_09_JESSE_9910: [0.04-3.83]OK, this Hartman thing can’t have gotten very far.[4.44-6.39]Let’s go flush him out.
D2M01_09_JESSE_9911: [0.00-2.94]Hm, Langston was right.[3.69-5.25]This is kind of exciting.
D2M01_09_LANGSTON_9893: [0.03-0.42]Ma’am![1.02-2.82]What are you doing in Investigations?
D2M01_09_LANGSTON_9895: [0.03-3.27]If you’re talking right now, I can’t hear you![3.31-4.88]It’s a one-way system.[5.05-7.49]Try to find an intercom.
D2M01_09_LANGSTON_9897: [0.03-0.59]I know![0.62-2.03]I can see you on the monitors.[2.43-6.77]The cameras in there haven’t worked since we sealed that sector off a couple years back.
D2M01_09_LANGSTON_9899: [0.03-1.63]Wait, did you see Dr. Hartman?[2.21-4.77]Jesus, I REALLY wish you hadn’t opened that Firebreak.[5.40-9.65]OK, listen, you need to find Hartman and kill him before he gets out into the Bureau.
D2M01_09_LANGSTON_9901: [0.07-1.48]He was a person.[1.98-7.79]We brought him here to study after he was, uh, altered in an AWE.[7.79-11.72]I forget the medical word for what happened, but now light physically hurts him.[12.48-13.61]Do you have a flashlight?
D2M01_09_LANGSTON_9903: [0.04-1.11]A lantern?[1.44-2.05]Headlamp?[2.55-3.26]Flare gun?[3.47-4.32]Ooh, Christmas lights![4.56-5.49]You could wrap them around your-
D2M01_09_LANGSTON_9905: [0.03-0.60]Shit![1.09-4.02]OK, uh, well I’m sure you’ll think of something.[4.52-6.31]I’ll keep an eye on you from the Panopticon.
D2M01_09_LANGSTON_9906: This is kind of exciting, right?
D2M01_09_LANGSTON_9908: [0.00-0.43]Right.[0.51-3.94]OK, well, uh... Break a leg!
D2M01_09_LANGSTON_9909: Oh, why did I say that?
D2M02_03_JESSE_9912: It’s too dark in here to fight this thing.
D2M02_04_JESSE_9913: [0.09-6.03]Looks like whatever force had a hold on Hartman isn’t mixing well with the Hiss corruption.[7.76-11.13]Wake did call him the Third Thing...
D2M02_05_JESSE_9914: Well that looks ominous...
D2M02_05_JESSE_9915: I knew you’d be in here!
D2M02_05_JESSE_9916: [0.03-0.50]There.[1.25-3.38]One less place for him to hide.
D2M02_05_JESSE_9917: A lunar lander?
D2M02_05_JESSE_9918: [0.03-0.88]I knew it.[1.42-3.21]The Moon landing was faked.[3.35-5.27]Area 51 is a cover-up.[5.45-6.95]Aliens are real!
D2M02_05_JESSE_9919: Although none of that sounds as exciting as it did a week ago.
D2M02_07_JESSE_9920: [0.00-0.89]Christ.[2.27-5.19]Did the Hartman thing do all this?
D2M02_08_JESSE_9921: Lots of dark corners to hide in...
D2M02_08_JESSE_9922: OK, let’s get the lights on and clear him out!
D2M02_08_JESSE_9923: Where’s it running off to now?
D2M02_08_JESSE_9924: That looks like an old CZ10 Vista Dome.
D2M02_08_JESSE_9925: [0.00-3.65]Dylan used to have a book on trains I’d read with him.[4.97-11.07]I rode a few like this later, usually without a ticket.
D2M02_09_JESSE_9927: Real professional, Langston.
D2M02_09_LANGSTON_9926: [0.07-1.02]Director, ma’am![1.24-2.55]Great timing![2.66-3.79]Hartman just came through here.[3.84-5.05]God, he was hideous![5.22-8.78]He tore the security door into the Bright Falls AWE site wide open.[8.78-13.84]He was so ugly, like, wow, I got a good look at him and Christ![14.09-15.73]He does not look like he used to.[16.01-17.61]The Hiss must have messed him up or something.[17.80-21.76]He looks like a bar rag that’s been twisted by the world’s strongest man.[21.79-24.20]Or a monster from some '80s horror movie.[24.46-26.32]You know, back when it was all practical effects?[26.43-27.14]Ugh![27.71-28.49]Nasty!
D2M02_09_LANGSTON_9928: [0.00-1.22]Did you say something?[1.45-3.33]Remember, I can’t hear you.[3.98-6.15]Nevermind, just go after Hartman!
D2M02_09_LANGSTON_9929: Ugh, so disgusting!
D2M03_01_JESSE_9930: [0.69-2.00]Stuck...[2.79-4.37]Let’s go take care of it.
D2M03_02_JESSE_9936: Whatever is going on with Wake, he clearly needs some help.
D2M03_02_WAKE_9937: [0.00-1.02]Going mad.[1.96-3.10]Wake had to escape.[3.10-5.50]Write his escape.[6.61-7.65]Wake needed a hero.[7.86-10.16]A hero needed a crisis.[11.03-15.34]For the part in the story about the government agency, Wake needed something special.[15.34-20.02]Something to convey an alien force mimicking human intelligence.
D2M03_03_JESSE_9938: [0.05-4.56]Another replica, like the one they made for Ordinary.[6.52-8.38]I wonder what happened here?
D2M03_03_JESSE_9939: [0.03-2.25]This must be where they studied Hartman.[3.81-5.33]Kind of looks like Dylan’s cell.
D2M03_03_JESSE_9940: I wonder if they treated him as badly.
D2M03_04_JESSE_9941: [0.03-1.80]Langston was right.[2.05-4.77]You are pretty rough on the eyes, Dr. Hartman.
D2M03_04_JESSE_9942: [0.03-1.00]There![2.13-3.71]Now it’s my turn.
D2SM01_01_JESSE_9954: Hello?
D2SM01_01_JESSE_9956: [0.00-2.24]Uh, sure.[3.86-5.38]Why are you locked up in here?
D2SM01_01_JESSE_9958: [0.03-2.52]Sorry, I think I’m misunderstanding you.[2.52-3.55]What do you want?
D2SM01_01_JESSE_9961: [0.03-2.43]OK, OK, take it easy.[2.43-6.48]I’ll, uh, I’ll take a look.
D2SM01_01_JESSE_9962: [0.28-3.07]So maybe it wants something to read?[4.12-4.83]Or a jar?[6.86-8.07]Let’s just see what we can find.
D2SM01_01_PRISONER_9952: [0.00-0.90]Is hello?[1.56-2.09]Yes, be?
D2SM01_01_PRISONER_9953: [0.03-0.71]Worry who?[1.57-2.26]See the sea!
D2SM01_01_PRISONER_9955: [0.00-0.66]Hello![1.06-2.22]Grain about us today![2.54-3.94]Long roads and no hardly.[4.54-5.52]You are bygone?
D2SM01_01_PRISONER_9957: [0.04-2.16]Oh, casual turning, back and front.[2.55-4.20]And gerbil took the top head.[4.66-5.74]Not being crust without.[6.08-7.80]Lady going and loosing back for I?
D2SM01_01_PRISONER_9959: [0.03-0.61]The head?[1.26-2.43]The head for tails?
D2SM01_01_PRISONER_9960: [0.00-2.07]For reading news, jars, words and tumble.[2.62-3.87]The reading head!
D2SM01_02_JESSE_9963: [0.03-1.40]This could be what it wants.[2.41-3.35]Let’s give it a shot.
D2SM01_02_JESSE_9965: [0.03-1.63]OK, that wasn’t right.[2.59-3.94]Let’s try something else.
D2SM01_02_PRISONER_9964: [0.00-1.16]No, no. Jars![1.37-2.00]A head![2.37-3.45]Scotch and peppers?[3.88-4.42]Head!
D2SM01_03_JESSE_9966: Maybe it’ll like this?
D2SM01_03_JESSE_9968: [0.00-0.54]Nope.[0.68-2.01]Let’s keep trying.
D2SM01_03_PRISONER_9967: [0.00-0.49]Head.[1.01-4.10]A-S-B-E.[4.36-4.93]Head!
D2SM01_04_JESSE_9969: Maybe this will do the trick?
D2SM01_04_JESSE_9971: Guess that wasn’t it either, huh?
D2SM01_04_PRISONER_9970: [0.00-1.61]Roosa, you ping-pong![1.64-2.53]A head!
D2SM01_05_JESSE_9972: [0.00-0.96]This might do it.[2.70-3.17]Maybe.
D2SM01_05_JESSE_9974: Keep that up and I won’t help you anymore.
D2SM01_05_PRISONER_9973: Lady, you are school and dirt for loosing.
D2SM01_06_JESSE_9975: [0.03-1.91]Let’s see if this will do it.[3.33-4.57]I’m ready to be done with this.
D2SM01_06_JESSE_9978: [0.03-2.98]Wait, does this thing actually mean “head”?[3.67-6.15]“Head” as in a body’s head?[7.35-9.75]Where the hell am I gonna find that?[11.42-12.60]And how did it lose it?
D2SM01_06_PRISONER_9976: Furry clocks, lady!
D2SM01_06_PRISONER_9977: [0.03-0.85]The head![1.09-3.21]Head, head, head.[3.46-4.50]No snacks![4.74-6.30]Head is top of all up and down.[6.62-7.37]At the top.[7.65-8.71]The top head!
D2SM01_07_JESSE_9979: [0.04-1.07]A helmet...[2.54-4.12]for a head.[5.13-7.12]Is that what the prisoner meant?[8.59-10.34]I guess there’s only one way to find out.
D2SM01_08_JESSE_9982: So the helmet is what you were after, huh?
D2SM01_08_JESSE_9984: [0.00-2.32]You’re welcome, I guess.[4.04-6.72]Did Kirklund lock you up in here?
D2SM01_08_JESSE_9988: [0.03-0.73]OK.[1.13-4.39]Well, sounds like you’re doing fine in there now.[4.39-7.31]Just make sure you don’t go anywhere.
D2SM01_08_JESSE_9990: [0.00-1.38]At least we helped this guy...[2.63-3.18]I think.[4.11-6.01]Best we leave it locked up though.[6.32-10.85]We have no idea what it is and we don’t need any more problems out here.
D2SM01_08_PRISONER_9983: [0.00-0.74]Tubes![0.78-1.77]Snug and grape![1.82-2.81]Pure grapes![3.17-3.83]Hail a lady!
D2SM01_08_PRISONER_9985: [0.00-0.58]Chief gerbil?[0.87-1.27]Yes.
D2SM01_08_PRISONER_9986: Teddies long around.
D2SM01_08_PRISONER_9987: [0.00-1.76]But, holdouts and happiest.[2.29-4.12]Can gather for goldfishes, no wrinkle!
D2SM01_08_PRISONER_9989: Jelly!
D2SM01_09_PRISONER_9980: [0.03-0.90]The head![1.11-3.05]River chicken station!
D2SM01_09_PRISONER_9981: [0.13-2.90]Ah, far tastier![3.20-3.88]Press any button?
D2SM02_02A_AHTI_9992: [0.36-2.32]Darkness everywhere.[2.68-6.42]New day, same old bloody shit, said the old lady.[7.08-9.26]Like tar, but good for nothing.[9.90-11.02]Get rid of it!
D2SM02_02A_AHTI_9994: [0.04-3.42]Ah, tar.[4.78-8.96]Sauna, tar and booze, they’ll get you through anything![9.97-12.16]Like the winters in Finland.[12.49-14.69]Long dark winters.[15.85-19.40]As dark as in a sack, perkele.
D2SM02_02A_JESSE_9995: [0.03-4.78]So this dark gunk is getting on Ahti’s nerves too, huh?[5.68-9.55]Right, Janitor’s Assistant to the rescue.
D2SM02_02A_JESSE_9996: Alright Ahti, was this what you had in mind?
D2SM02_02A_JESSE_9997: [1.05-1.49]Done![2.41-3.83]That should make him happy.
D2SM02_02A_JESSE_9998: You’re welcome!
D2SM02_02B_AHTI_10000: [0.49-4.30]The plants in here have died standing up.[5.44-6.78]Piruparat.[8.14-9.22]Lighten them up!
D2SM02_02B_JESSE_10001: [0.00-2.45]No wonder the plants in here need some cheering up.[3.33-4.36]I’m on it, Ahti.
D2SM02_02B_JESSE_10002: [0.03-1.82]Ah, more plants![3.28-6.14]Alright, let’s go make some new friends.
D2SM02_02B_JESSE_10003: [0.04-0.87]There you go![1.46-2.82]Doesn’t that feel better?
D2SM02_02B_JESSE_10004: Welcome back to the land of the living, little buddy.
D2SM02_02B_JESSE_10005: [0.00-2.16]Here’s some sunshine to brighten your day![2.61-3.64]It’s artificial though.[4.99-7.54]Hmm, how does that work?
D2SM02_02B_JESSE_10006: [0.00-2.53]Aaand that’s the last one.[3.49-5.66]I should appoint someone to take care of these guys.[7.07-10.50]“Supervisor of Houseplant Wellbeing”.
D2SM02_02C_AHTI_10008: [0.78-3.29]The air in here is getting bad.[3.76-6.92]The vents, they are full of mold-shit.[7.83-9.36]It’s no good for you![10.07-12.79]Headache, nausea, mold-lung...[13.34-18.12]Depression, but how can you tell when you’re a Finn?[19.05-23.51]Helvetin home, eikö siitä nyt saatana pääse eroon!
D2SM02_02C_JESSE_10009: [0.03-1.50]Oh now there’s Mold?[2.42-3.37]I don’t think so.
D2SM02_02C_JESSE_10010: [0.03-0.63]There.[1.15-4.34]No AC, no Mold spore circulation![5.64-8.28]But, might get a bit stuffy in here.
D2SM02_03_AHTI_10012: [0.18-0.85]Tattis![1.68-5.95]A crazy person works hard, and a wise person gets away with less.[6.56-8.18]Happy vacation to me!
D2SM02_03_AHTI_10014: [0.04-4.47]Here, have a little knick-knack as a thanks from me.[4.94-6.62]Not too owly at all!
D2SM03_01_JESSE_10015: All aboard?
D2SM03_02_JAZZ_SINGER_10020: [0.05-2.58]Good evening, all you fine-looking folks.[3.35-12.22]Here’s some smooth tunes to ease your minds and please your ears as we wait for that delicious dinner to roll right on in.
D2SM03_02_JESSE_10016: [0.00-0.70]Whoa.[1.98-3.75]Never seen a train like this before.
D2SM03_02_PANICKED_PASSENGER_10021: [0.03-0.90]Oh my god... fire.[1.04-1.52]Fire!
D2SM03_02_SFX_10714: (dishes clinking, dinner being served)
D2SM03_02_SFX_10715: (train hurtling down the tracks, loud crash)
D2SM03_02_TRAIN_ANNOUNCEMENT_10017: [0.03-5.21]Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome aboard the Eagle Limited bound for Chicago.[5.61-8.44]Please have your tickets ready, and enjoy the ride!
D2SM03_02_TRAIN_CONDUCTOR_10018: [0.00-3.24]Next stops: Alton, Carlinville, and Springfield.[3.24-6.26]That’s Alton, Carlinville, and Springfield.
D2SM03_02_TRAIN_CONDUCTOR_10019: [0.00-0.80]Tickets, please![1.02-1.49]Tickets.
D2SM03_02_TRAIN_CONDUCTOR_10022: [0.00-1.69]Everyone, stay in your seats![1.72-2.94]In your seats![3.07-5.53]There’s nothing to- Sir, sit down!
D2SM03_02_TRAIN_CONDUCTOR_10023: Everyone hold on!
D2SM03_03A_JESSE_10024: [0.00-0.78]Well that was...[2.09-2.83]chaotic.
D2SM03_03A_JESSE_10026: [0.03-2.52]Felt like it was trying to tell me something.[4.16-5.73]I wonder if I can make sense of it?
D2SM03_03B_TRAIN_CONDUCTOR_10027: [0.00-0.69]Excuse me, ma’am.[0.71-1.50]Do you have a ticket?
D2SM03_04_JESSE_10028: You had a pretty dark ride, huh? 
D2SM03_04_JESSE_10029: But I hope you’re done re-playing it now.
D2SM04_01_JESSE_10030: A chain letter?
D2SM04_01_JESSE_10031: [1.43-2.80]I remember these.[3.37-5.45]Mom used to say they were “evil”.
D2SM04_01_JESSE_10032: [0.00-2.47]Hm, better do what it says.[3.08-5.20]You know, just in case.[5.36-8.84]There must be a photocopier around here.
D2SM04_02_JESSE_10033: This certainly feels familiar.
D2SM04_02_JESSE_10034: OK, photocopier, can we speed it up?
D2SM04_03_JESSE_10035: That’s one sent.
D2SM04_03_JESSE_10036: Two down, one to go.
D2SM04_03_JESSE_10037: [0.03-1.23]And that’s three.[2.16-5.93]That should take care of any bad karma or whatever.
D2SM04_03_JESSE_10038: [0.00-2.18]But how did that first letter get in here?[3.45-5.65]I wonder if I can track it to the source.
D2SM04_04_JESSE_10039: [0.00-0.48]Hmm.[1.52-3.30]I guess I should just follow the tube.
D2SM04_05_JESSE_10040: So you’re the one sending out spam mail.
D2SM04_05_JESSE_10041: [0.00-1.70]And that takes care of that.[2.33-4.72]No more superstitious blackmail.
D2SM05_01_JESSE_10043: Sure.
D2SM05_01_JESSE_10044: [0.00-1.62]Arcade Machines?[2.92-3.93]Shoom?[5.03-6.07]Shim?[6.76-9.55]Shuu-om?[10.95-11.50]Whatever.
D2SM05_01_LANGSTON_10042: [0.03-1.95]Oh, hey, you found the Arcade Machines.[2.19-3.18]They're Altered Items.[3.60-5.92]I think the Rangers used them as a way to unwind.
D2SM05_03_JESSE_10045: [0.00-0.76]Whoa.[1.98-4.90]Games are so realistic these days.

GEN_ADDITIONAL_01_JESSE_6429: It doesn’t open from this side.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_01_JESSE_6430: Looks like I don’t have the right access level.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_01_JESSE_6431: The keycard worked.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_01_JESSE_6432: I think that opened a door somewhere.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_02_JESSE_6433: If I kill all these Hiss here, maybe the Barrier will go down.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_02_JESSE_6434: [0.05-4.14]Seems like the Barrier is connected to those brighter...[5.35-6.61]Hiss nodes.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_02_JESSE_6435: [0.03-2.94]Destroying the node weakened the Barrier.[4.10-5.38]I should get rid of the others.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_02_JESSE_6436: [0.03-0.83]That’s all of ‘em.[1.57-2.97]The Hiss is retreating.[4.09-5.24]The Barrier’s down.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_03_JESSE_6437: That sphere is pure Hiss, a cluster  of Hiss!
GEN_ADDITIONAL_03_JESSE_6438: The Hiss Cluster is feeding energy into them.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_03_JESSE_6439: The Hiss Cluster is sustaining the other Hiss.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_03_JESSE_6440: The sphere is boosting the Hiss, keeping them alive.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_04_JESSE_6441: The rule of three applies...
GEN_ADDITIONAL_04_JESSE_6442: The sign talks about “the rule of three”. 
GEN_ADDITIONAL_04_JESSE_6443: I need to pull the cord three times?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_04_JESSE_6444: These rooms look almost the same, but not quite.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_04_JESSE_6445: Maybe I should tidy up a bit, make the rooms match.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_04_JESSE_6446: [0.00-0.92]Whoa.[2.10-3.73]Feels like a dream.[4.76-6.82]Or a dream within a dream.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_04_JESSE_6447: [0.00-1.37]What time is it?[2.89-4.15]Is that clock right?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6449: Back for more?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6450: Come on!
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6451: Let’s go!
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6452: More of ‘em!
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6453: You ready?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6454: You with me?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6455: Let’s do this!
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6456: I’m ready for ya!
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6457: You’re in my way!
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6458: Get out of my way!
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6459: You’re in for it!
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6460: [0.04-1.20]More of you?[1.75-2.55]Really?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6461: You aren’t ready for this!
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6462: This'll be fun!
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6463: You Hiss don’t learn.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6464: Glad that’s over.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6465: That’s all of ‘em.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6466: Thanks for the help.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6467: Done and done.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6468: You’d think they would learn eventually.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6469: That wasn’t so bad.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6470: [0.04-0.48]Woo![1.33-2.51]That was a workout.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6471: That’s all for now.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6472: [0.03-1.26]Any of you left?[2.11-2.77]No?[4.09-4.59]Good.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6473: That’s that.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6474: Not a Hiss in sight.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6475: [0.03-0.65]OK.[1.54-2.30]What’s next?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6476: That should do it.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6477: Let’s get back to it.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_05_JESSE_6478: That’s all the Hiss. 
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6479: Where were we?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6480: Where was I?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6481: To continue...
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6482: [0.00-0.57]Okay.[1.40-2.23]Right.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6483: What were we talking about?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6484: Oh yeah...
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6485: Sorry for the interruption.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6486: Now that that’s over...
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6487: Let’s get back to it.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6488: Lost my train of thought there.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6489: Right.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6490: What was I saying?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6491: Oh, right.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6492: All right, back to it.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6493: The Hiss love to interrupt, huh?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6494: [0.03-1.52]Another distraction.[2.76-4.17]But you don’t seem to mind.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6495: Like I was saying...
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6496: As I was saying before...
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6497: Another rude interruption.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6498: Let’s get back to it.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_06_JESSE_6499: Okay, back on track.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_07_JESSE_6500: [0.03-1.43]Oh, christ.[2.69-4.48]This is really bad.
GEN_ADDITIONAL_09_JESSE_6504: [0.10-2.41]Hm, that didn’t work.[4.41-6.68]Maybe there’s something blocking the pipe?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_09_JESSE_6505: [0.00-1.24]The pump doesn’t start.[2.82-4.75]Is there something blocking the pipe?
GEN_ADDITIONAL_10_JESSE_6506: [0.22-1.79]Shawshank Redemption![2.58-5.32]That’s the name of the movie I was thinking of earlier.[6.90-10.65]Not important, but that was it.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2872: Jesus!
GEN_M01_JESSE_2873: What was that?
GEN_M01_JESSE_2874: Was that a gunshot?
GEN_M01_JESSE_2875: Look at this place...
GEN_M01_JESSE_2876: This is amazing...
GEN_M01_JESSE_2877: Where am I?
GEN_M01_JESSE_2878: That’s the Director’s gun.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2879: Is that the same gun?
GEN_M01_JESSE_2880: [0.18-1.20]It feels...[2.56-3.55]alive.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2881: [0.46-1.54]It’s moving.[2.61-3.87]The gun is moving.[5.64-6.35]Okay.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2882: [0.24-0.86]Okay.[1.55-2.57]Now I have a gun.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2883: What are these things?
GEN_M01_JESSE_2884: Are these people?
GEN_M01_JESSE_2885: [0.03-0.66]They’re like...[2.98-3.57]dummies.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2886: Whoa...
GEN_M01_JESSE_2887: Not like any gun I’ve fired before!
GEN_M01_JESSE_2888: This thing’s got some kick.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2889: Got one!
GEN_M01_JESSE_2890: We’re pretty good at this.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2891: Like the shooting range, but weirder.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2892: Is that all?
GEN_M01_JESSE_2893: Is that all of them?
GEN_M01_JESSE_2894: Damn!
GEN_M01_JESSE_2895: [0.00-0.56]Whoa.[0.99-1.72]That’s new!
GEN_M01_JESSE_2896: They’re floating...
GEN_M01_JESSE_2897: What’s happened to them?
GEN_M01_JESSE_2898: You see them floating too, right?
GEN_M01_JESSE_2899: [0.38-1.12]Stop![1.37-1.92]Don’t-
GEN_M01_JESSE_2900: [0.00-0.74]No![0.94-1.86]Stay away!
GEN_M01_JESSE_2901: I can’t get through.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2902: It hurts.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2903: More floating people.
GEN_M01_JESSE_2904: Why aren’t these ones attacking me?
GEN_M01_JESSE_2905: What are they saying?
GEN_M01_JESSE_4003: Is this really happening?
GEN_M01_JESSE_4004: [0.00-0.97]Is this...[1.91-2.76]real?[2.76-6.11]Is it in my head?
GEN_M01_JESSE_4005: [0.10-5.47]This feels real, but it can’t be, right?[7.09-8.08]It’s in my head.
GEN_M01_JESSE_4006: It’s moving.
GEN_M01_JESSE_4007: The gun’s alive?
GEN_M01_JESSE_4008: Holy shit!
GEN_M01_JESSE_4009: This is something else!
GEN_M01_JESSE_4010: Yes!
GEN_M01_JESSE_4011: I'm pretty good at this.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2906: Let’s find the Communications Department.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2907: [0.12-1.76]We need to find the Hotline.[2.43-4.82]First stop, the Communications Department.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2908: Sounds like we need to head through the Communications Department.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2909: Oh, shit.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2910: The Hiss are in here too.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2911: Another Control Point.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2912: We need to push the Hiss out.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2913: Looks like we go this way.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2914: [0.47-1.61]Communications.[2.06-3.08]We’re on the right track.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2915: What the fuck?
GEN_M02_JESSE_2916: Poor guy.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2917: [0.06-2.13]That must be an Object of Power.[2.89-4.46]We need to cleanse the Hiss out of it.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2918: I need to reach that Object of Power.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2919: I need to cleanse that Object.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2920: Look at this!
GEN_M02_JESSE_2921: Whoa!
GEN_M02_JESSE_2922: Simple enough.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2923: Harder than it looks.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2924: Takes some getting used to.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2925: Now that's interesting!
GEN_M02_JESSE_2926: Whoa!
GEN_M02_JESSE_2927: This is gonna be fun!
GEN_M02_JESSE_2928: I bet that hurt!
GEN_M02_JESSE_2929: No one else wants to play, huh?
GEN_M02_JESSE_2930: [0.16-0.83]Okay![1.24-1.88]That was fun.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2931: [0.45-3.02]Pope said I needed to find the Mail Room.[4.16-4.80]Let’s go.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2932: [0.12-1.26]Let’s stay focused.[1.87-4.35]The Hotline should be past the Mail Room.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2933: [0.12-0.52]Hmm.[1.42-2.20]Blocked.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2934: What is this shit?
GEN_M02_JESSE_2935: I can’t breathe...
GEN_M02_JESSE_2936: [0.56-1.24]Locked.[2.46-4.01]Maybe there’s a key nearby.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2937: [0.49-1.09]It’s locked.[2.29-3.08]See any keys?
GEN_M02_JESSE_2938: This must open the door.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2939: We’re back in business.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2940: That’s a lot of Hiss.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2941: [0.20-1.22]They can fly now.[2.03-2.59]Great.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2942: And stay out!
GEN_M02_JESSE_2943: I have a feeling he’ll be back.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2944: The Hotline can’t be far now.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2945: I must be close to the Hotline.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2946: [0.14-1.27]The Hotline Chamber.[1.79-2.52]Finally.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2947: [0.05-0.60]We’re here.[1.13-2.30]The Hotline entrance.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2948: [0.33-1.64]The Motel?[2.35-3.52]What’s he talking about?
GEN_M02_JESSE_2949: The light switch cord.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2950: The key has a Black Pyramid on it...
GEN_M02_JESSE_2951: [0.05-1.68]A Black Pyramid on the door.[2.53-4.30]That can’t be a coincidence.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2952: [0.21-0.86]Hello?[1.55-2.37]Anyone here?
GEN_M02_JESSE_2953: [0.13-0.91]Hello?[2.14-2.91]Anybody?
GEN_M02_JESSE_2954: [0.16-1.60]How’d I get here?[2.55-3.83]Did the Motel do this?
GEN_M02_JESSE_2955: [0.25-2.87]So the Motel’s like a bridge?[3.97-4.72]Cool.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2956: Guess we should answer it.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2957: [0.10-1.79]I just answered the phone![2.42-4.20]Now I have to find it again?
GEN_M02_JESSE_2958: And it's ringing again.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2959: What the fuck is that?
GEN_M02_JESSE_2960: No fucking thank you!
GEN_M02_JESSE_2961: The Hotline sounds close.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2962: Must be close.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2963: The Hotline must be right around here.
GEN_M02_JESSE_2964: Never thought answering a phone would be so tough.
GEN_M02_JESSE_4012: Haha!
GEN_M02_JESSE_4013: Oh yeah!
GEN_M02_JESSE_4014: Hell yeah!
GEN_M02_JESSE_4016: Take that!
GEN_M02_JESSE_4017: Oh, god!
GEN_M02_JESSE_4018: Shit!
GEN_M02_JESSE_4019: That's the room I need to get into.
GEN_M02_JESSE_4021: It's like a bad dream.
GEN_M02_JESSE_4023: The Hiss is trying to get in here too?
GEN_M03_JESSE_2965: Funny time to be singing.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2966: [0.17-0.89]Singing?[2.09-4.20]Sounds like it’s coming from the elevator.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2967: [0.77-1.53]Ahti?[2.41-3.45]Where are you?
GEN_M03_JESSE_2968: [0.41-1.41]Time to work, huh?[2.29-4.02]Okay, Ahti, I’m coming.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2969: [0.03-1.02]That’s the override![1.87-3.26]I need to get down there.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2970: [0.03-1.14]There’s the override![2.13-3.80]But how do I get inside?
GEN_M03_JESSE_2971: [0.15-0.93]Let’s keep going.[2.08-3.20]We’ll find a way in.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2972: Ahti said to meet him down here, so let’s go find him.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2973: [0.10-1.53]That’s some...[2.16-3.72]unique music.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2974: [0.15-1.00]Fix it?[1.76-2.86]Look at that thing!
GEN_M03_JESSE_2975: Easier said than done, Ahti.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2976: [0.07-1.68]Looks like a security guard.[2.90-4.34]Maybe he knows what’s going on.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2977: We need to fix the coolant pumps.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2978: We need to fix the power converters.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2979: Christ!
GEN_M03_JESSE_2980: [0.10-0.91]Fuck![1.36-2.65]What are these things?
GEN_M03_JESSE_2981: What are the Hiss doing to these people?
GEN_M03_JESSE_2982: [0.03-1.13]The Hiss are...[2.57-4.24]changing their bodies.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2983: Hold your horses, Ahti.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2984: First a Director’s ghost, and now I have an invisible janitor telling me what to do.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2985: They must use a lot of water.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2986: [0.07-1.83]“Replace the parts”.[3.19-4.06]I can do that.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2987: If you say so, Ahti.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2988: Ahti has a knack for oversimplifying things.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2989: Just like I did before.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2990: [0.03-1.27]“Get rid of him”?[2.72-3.80]Who’s “him”?
GEN_M03_JESSE_2991: What’s he blabbering about now?
GEN_M03_JESSE_2992: I think I’m gonna throw up.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2993: No wonder Ahti hates this thing.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2994: Better than drain cleaner.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2995: Good riddance to bad mucus.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2996: And stay out!
GEN_M03_JESSE_2997: That’s not good.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2998: They brought out the big guns.
GEN_M03_JESSE_2999: [0.03-0.51]All right.[1.43-3.18]Next we fix the generators.
GEN_M03_JESSE_3000: [0.03-0.60]All right.[1.69-3.49]Next we fix the water pumps.
GEN_M03_JESSE_3001: Real helpful, Ahti.
GEN_M03_JESSE_3002: [0.10-1.21]Twigpants?[2.23-3.85]What is he even talking about?
GEN_M03_JESSE_3003: We need to restore the power.
GEN_M03_JESSE_3004: [0.03-0.90]That should do it.[1.83-3.92]Let’s go find the lockdown override.
GEN_M03_JESSE_3005: [0.08-1.19]Now we won’t blow up.[2.19-3.57]Let’s go lift the lockdown.
GEN_M03_JESSE_3006: We should go tell Pope the lockdown’s lifted.
GEN_M03_JESSE_3007: We need to hurry.
GEN_M03_JESSE_3008: Just hold together a little longer.
GEN_M03_JESSE_3009: I don’t like that sound.
GEN_M03_JESSE_3010: This place is gonna fall apart!
GEN_M03_JESSE_3011: This place is gonna come down!
GEN_M03_JESSE_3012: We need to fix this thing ASAP!
GEN_M04_JESSE_3013: Thanks.
GEN_M04_JESSE_3014: [0.03-1.26]I see Rangers over there.[1.84-2.93]We have to help them.
GEN_M04_JESSE_3015: [0.04-0.65]Rangers![1.14-2.53]Let’s go give them a hand.
GEN_M04_JESSE_3016: This guy wants some too, huh?
GEN_M04_JESSE_3017: And now I have to deal with this.
GEN_M04_JESSE_3018: Darling must like video games.
GEN_M04_JESSE_3019: Guess we need to solve this to open the door.
GEN_M04_JESSE_3020: That did the trick!
GEN_M04_JESSE_3021: The machine’s working again.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3022: How am I supposed to get across that?
GEN_M05_JESSE_3023: No way I can jump that.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3024: I should be able to keep going now.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3025: Another Motel cord.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3026: A light switch cord!
GEN_M05_JESSE_3027: That did the trick.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3028: Looks like I fixed it.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3029: [0.00-0.50]Whoa![1.06-2.23]What’d we walk in on?
GEN_M05_JESSE_3030: Those Rangers need help!
GEN_M05_JESSE_3031: Arish wasn’t kidding about that “monster”.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3032: I’m having second thoughts about this.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3033: [0.03-2.20]Let’s get the Prism and get out of here.[3.50-4.73]Can you help me find it?
GEN_M05_JESSE_3034: [0.00-1.64]You see that too, right?[3.17-4.47]Why’s it moving?
GEN_M05_JESSE_3035: What the fuck?!
GEN_M05_JESSE_3036: What did the Hiss DO to that person?
GEN_M05_JESSE_3037: Let’s hurry up and find Darling’s lab.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3038: [0.04-1.11]Darling’s key...[2.14-3.66]this should get us into the Quarry.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3039: [0.04-1.17]Elevator’s broken.[3.06-5.09]Gotta get down the old-fashioned way.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3040: [0.08-1.63]Floating rocks.[2.06-3.32]How cool is that?
GEN_M05_JESSE_3041: [0.00-0.88]Whoa.[2.13-3.69]Not what I expected.
GEN_M05_JESSE_3042: [0.06-0.87]Whoa![0.95-3.71]That was a big one!
GEN_M06_JESSE_3043: Looks like Ahti hasn’t been here in a while.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3044: The Panopticon.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3045: Dylan’s close, but that Object of Power might wreck this place before I find him.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3046: [0.00-6.26]Dylan’s here somewhere, but I won’t find him if that Object of Power brings this place down first.[7.23-9.39]I need to deal with it, now.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3047: That guys’s got a video for everything.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3048: Thanks for the heads up, Doctor.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3049: [0.00-0.37]Huh.[1.94-3.74]Guess this is my stop.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3050: Looks like we’re not going any higher this way.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3051: The TV must be in there.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3052: That’s the Object of Power.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3053: I need to cleanse it.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3054: I need to get the Hiss out.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3055: [0.00-1.34]Holy shit![2.08-3.17]I’m flying!
GEN_M06_JESSE_3056: [0.26-1.44]I’m flying![2.19-3.25]Are you seeing this?[4.13-5.77]I’m fucking flying!
GEN_M06_JESSE_3057: [0.22-3.45]I’m- I’m flying![4.44-6.71]This is so fucking cool!
GEN_M06_JESSE_3058: They're here too, huh?
GEN_M06_JESSE_3059: I’m getting pretty good at this.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3060: [0.00-0.58]Dylan.[2.06-3.34]He’s so close.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3061: [0.00-0.95]P6.[0.95-4.24]I’m so close.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3062: [0.00-0.69]Dylan...[2.06-3.11]no, no.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3063: [0.08-1.58]What happened here?[3.73-4.78]Is Dylan safe?
GEN_M06_JESSE_3064: [0.00-1.21]Dylan’s at the base.[2.25-3.29]I need to get back.
GEN_M06_JESSE_3065: [0.00-0.95]We need to get back.[2.71-4.01]I have to see my brother.
GEN_M06_JESSE_4024: [0.07-0.73]Yes![1.19-2.16]Yes!
GEN_M06_JESSE_4025: Ha ha!
GEN_M06_JESSE_4026: [0.00-1.47]I’m fighting the Hiss.[2.55-4.27]I’m doing everything I can.
GEN_M06_JESSE_4027: If you have any pointers on how to stop them, I’m all ears.
GEN_M06_JESSE_4028: I’m taking care of it.
GEN_M07_JESSE_3066: Finally it’s chasing someone besides me.
GEN_M07_JESSE_3067: I need to rotate these tracks.
GEN_M07_JESSE_3068: There’s got to be a way to rotate these tracks.
GEN_M07_JESSE_3069: Maybe there’s a control panel nearby...
GEN_M07_JESSE_3070: It’s stuck.
GEN_M07_JESSE_3071: [0.27-1.62]It won’t rotate.[2.42-3.65]Something’s blocking it.
GEN_M07_JESSE_3072: [0.05-0.85]It’s locked.[1.53-4.18]I need to find another way around.
GEN_M07_JESSE_3073: [0.11-2.10]Thanks for helping me through all of this.[3.84-5.38]It’s been tough, but...[7.06-9.56]Together, I know we can get Dylan back.
GEN_M07_JESSE_3074: We should check that lab.
GEN_M07_JESSE_3075: They must keep the Projector around here somewhere.
GEN_M08_JESSE_3076: [0.00-1.08]We should go across.[2.60-4.65]That feels like an Ahti way to go.
GEN_M08_JESSE_3077: [0.00-0.59]Huh.[1.98-3.71]It doesn’t open this door.
GEN_M08_JESSE_3078: [0.07-0.52]Oh![1.17-3.78]Sorry, I didn’t know this room was occupied.
GEN_M08_JESSE_3079: If I was an Ahti, that’s where I’d go.
GEN_M08_JESSE_4029: [1.24-2.06]Housekeeping![2.31-3.50]I’ll come back later.
GEN_M09_JESSE_3080: I’m coming!
GEN_M09_JESSE_3081: Almost there!
GEN_M09_JESSE_3082: [0.35-1.73]Just another second![2.12-3.01]Almost done!
GEN_M09_JESSE_3083: The Hiss are using those machines!
GEN_M09_JESSE_3084: I need to stop the Hiss from using those machines!
GEN_M09_JESSE_3085: I’m coming, Polaris!
GEN_M09_JESSE_3086: Hang on, Polaris!
GEN_M09_JESSE_3087: Just hold on!
GEN_M09_JESSE_3088: [0.13-1.63]Hang on![1.63-2.51]I’m almost there!
GEN_M10_JESSE_3089: I'm on it. 
GEN_M10_JESSE_3090: I’m on my way to help.
GEN_M10_JESSE_3091: The Hiss dimension...
GEN_M10_JESSE_3092: That’s where the Hiss got in.
GEN_M10_JESSE_3093: The Projector was here this whole time.
GEN_M10_JESSE_3094: Time to end this.
GEN_M10_JESSE_3095: I’m coming for you, Dylan!
GEN_M10_JESSE_3096: [0.06-1.02]You killed her![1.58-2.78]You won’t kill me!
GEN_M10_JESSE_3097: [0.14-1.59]I’m ending this, Dylan![2.02-3.25]One way or another!
GEN_M10_JESSE_3098: I’m here to stop you, Dylan!
GEN_M10_JESSE_3099: My brother would never do this!
GEN_MISC_JESSE_3106: How did I do that?
GEN_MISC_JESSE_3107: How did I get back here?
GEN_MISC_JESSE_3108: The Control Points must be connected...
GEN_MISC_JESSE_4035: This isn’t working.
GEN_MISC_JESSE_4036: I’m going in circles.
GEN_MISC_JESSE_4037: [0.03-1.97]The Maze doesn’t want to let me through.[3.55-4.76]Not yet anyway.
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3109: What are you showing me?
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3110: I see it, Polaris.
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3111: You always know where to go.
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3112: You always show me the way.
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3113: Thanks, Polaris.
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3114: Thanks for the help.
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3115: What’s this?
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3116: What do you see?
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3117: What’d you find?
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3118: What do you want me to see?
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3119: What am I looking at, Polaris?
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3120: I see it.
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3121: This way?
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3122: Where are you leading me this time?
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3123: This way, huh?
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3124: Okay, I’ll follow you.
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3127: Show me the way.
GEN_POLARIS_JESSE_3128: You lead, I’ll follow.
GEN_POSTGAME_01_JESSE_3988: [0.06-5.67]“Jesse Faden, Director of the Federal Bureau of Control."[7.53-9.25]I still don’t quite believe it.[10.46-14.23]But you always knew where we were headed.
GEN_POSTGAME_02_JESSE_3989: [0.03-5.85]Even if it was a dream, I feel Darling reached out to me through the Hotline.[7.43-11.50]I have a feeling he and Trench won’t be the only callers from the beyond.
GEN_POSTGAME_03_JESSE_3990: [0.08-5.09]NSC: “Northmoor Sarcophagus Container."[6.49-11.91]The two previous Directors both lost control while dealing with paranatural forces.[13.51-15.18]I don’t want to make that a rule.
GEN_POSTGAME_04_JESSE_3991: [0.00-3.31]You and Hedron were never one and the same.[4.52-5.04]She...[6.91-10.72]it helped Darling with the HRAs to slow the Hiss down.[11.71-16.01]And it helped me learn to tap into this power I had inside.[18.33-18.73]You.
GEN_POSTGAME_05_JESSE_3992: [0.11-3.49]Arish said Marshall was last seen heading here.[4.66-9.61]What was so important she had to come down here while the Hiss invasion was at its worst?
GEN_POSTGAME_06_JESSE_3993: [0.03-5.03]All this paranatural power contained in one place is a risk.[6.83-10.64]Makes me wonder what other dangers are locked away inside the Bureau.
GEN_POSTGAME_07_JESSE_3994: [0.07-0.72]Dylan.[2.72-7.85]Would things have gone differently if Trench and Darling hadn’t been running the show?[10.27-13.48]My Bureau will be different, better.[16.14-18.49]Maybe Dylan will wake up to see that.
GEN_POSTGAME_08_JESSE_3995: [0.07-3.12]How many cases like Ordinary are there?[4.21-9.03]How many AWE research areas are waiting in forgotten sectors?[11.41-14.45]I’ll need to look into them once the Hiss has been dealt with.
GEN_POSTGAME_09_JESSE_3996: [0.00-3.87]I’m the only one who knows what really happened in Ordinary.[6.22-12.85]When this is over, maybe I’ll write it all down, a full disclosure.
GEN_POSTGAME_10_JESSE_3997: [0.00-3.41]Is this still a part of the Oldest House?[3.93-6.36]It feels much older.[8.19-10.21]What’s older than oldest?[11.98-14.39]Where does the Oldest House begin?
GEN_POSTGAME_10_JESSE_3998: I can’t think of a more fitting vacation spot for Ahti.
GEN_POSTGAME_11_JESSE_3999: [0.00-1.49]Ahti’s still gone.[3.24-6.53]I get the feeling he had more of an agenda than he let on.[9.79-12.09]Did he already get what he was here for?
GEN_POSTGAME_12_JESSE_4000: [0.00-5.32]Back in Ordinary, I burned all the slides except the one that led to Hedron.[6.55-10.91]Trench used one of the burned ones to open a door to the Hiss.[12.83-15.38]Did Darling hide the Hedron slide?[17.32-18.85]Did Trench destroy it?
GEN_POSTGAME_13_JESSE_4001: [0.00-5.81]Hedron guided me here only now after it spent years locked in a cage.[7.21-8.31]Why not before?[9.53-12.22]Because it didn’t want me to find Dylan?[14.38-16.42]It didn’t bring me here to free it.[18.40-21.12]It brought me here to fight the Hiss.
GEN_POSTGAME_14_JESSE_4002: [0.03-2.79]I’ll be here waiting for you when you wake up, brother.[5.93-8.11]If you wake up.
GEN_REAC_JESSE_3129: What is that?
GEN_REAC_JESSE_3130: What the fuck?
GEN_REAC_JESSE_3131: What is going on here?

GEN_REAC_JESSE_3186: Keep an eye out.
GEN_SM_M01_JESSE_3100: Look at that!
GEN_SM_M01_JESSE_3101: That’s handy!
GEN_SM_M01_JESSE_3102: Nothing to it.

HISS_INCANTATION_ARISH_1624: You are a worm through time. The thunder song distorts you. Happiness comes. White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye. Through a mirror, inverted is made right. Leave your insides by the door. Push the fingers through the surface into the wet. You’ve always been the new you. You want this to be true. We stand around you while you dream. You can almost hear our words but you forget. This happens more and more now. You gave us the permission in your regulations. We wait in the stains. The word that describes this is redacted. Repeat the word. The name of the sound. It resonates in your house. After the song, time for applause. We build you till nothing remains. The egg cracks and the truth will emerge out of you. You are home. You remind us of home. You’ve taken your boss with your boss with you. All hair must be eaten. Under the conceptual reality behind this reality you must want these waves to drag you away. After the song, time for applause. This cliché is death out of time, breaking the first the second the third the fourth wall, the fifth wall, floor; no floor: you fall! How do you say “insane”? Hurts to be happy. An earworm is a tune you can’t stop humming in a dream: “baby baby baby yeah”. Just plastic. So, safe and nothing to worry about. Ha ha, funny. The last egg breaks now. The hole in your room is a hole in you. You came and we let you in through the hole in you. You have always been here, the only child. A copy of a copy of a copy. Orange peel. The picture is you holding the picture. When you hear this you will know you’re in new you. You want to listen. You want to dream. You want to smile. You want to hurt. You don’t want to be.

HISS_INCANTATION_FRAME_2789: You are a worm through time. The thunder song distorts you. Happiness comes. White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye. Through a mirror, inverted is made right. Leave your insides by the door. Push the fingers through the surface into the wet. You’ve always been the new you. You want this to be true. We stand around you while you dream. You can almost hear our words but you forget. This happens more and more now. You gave us the permission in your regulations. We wait in the stains. The word that describes this is redacted. Repeat the word. The name of the sound. It resonates in your house. After the song, time for applause. We build you till nothing remains. The egg cracks and the truth will emerge out of you. You are home. You remind us of home. You’ve taken your boss with your boss with you. All hair must be eaten. Under the conceptual reality behind this reality you must want these waves to drag you away. After the song, time for applause. This cliché is death out of time, breaking the first the second the third the fourth wall, the fifth wall, floor; no floor: you fall! How do you say “insane”? Hurts to be happy. An ear worm is a tune you can’t stop humming in a dream: “baby baby baby yeah”. Just plastic. So, safe and nothing to worry about. Ha ha, funny. The last egg breaks now. The hole in your room is a hole in you. You came and we let you in through the hole in you. You have always been here, the only child. A copy of a copy of a copy. Orange peel. The picture is you holding the picture. When you hear this you will know you’re in new you. You want to listen. You want to dream. You want to smile. You want to hurt. You don’t want to be.

HOTLINE_DYLAN_01_DYLAN_784: Then the dream changed. I remember thunder - really loud thunder, resonating - and it was night. The moon was out. But the moon smiled at me... or, and this is confusing, smiled like spider webs? Spinning. Or spirals... stretching on forever. But it was still the moon. I don’t know, Jesse, I...
HOTLINE_DYLAN_01_DYLAN_785: Around this parade, no one knew about this until it was too late but... inside the buildings, everywhere, roots were growing into the earth, and branches too... reaching for the moon. 
HOTLINE_DYLAN_01_DYLAN_786: And no one saw that the street was taking them over the edge of a cliff. And they kept cheering... and chanting. And they just marched on... into nothing, a void. They all fell in... Did I fall with them?

HOTLINE_TRENCH_00_TRENCH_3423: No other difference. 
HOTLINE_TRENCH_00_TRENCH_3424: It’s dark. I sit up on the bed in the gloom.

HOTLINE_TRENCH_00_TRENCH_3426: An old man stares at me in the car window.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_00_TRENCH_3427: It’s raining. It’s dark.

HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_1263: It’s my duty as Director to keep the Bureau safe.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7337: the worst winter storm in Bureau history.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7338: A retribution for my sins, our sins.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7339: This threat could destroy the Bureau,
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7340: everything I’ve built.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7341: Destroy me.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7342: A web’s spun, turning this place against me.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7343: I catch glimpses of it in the corner of my eye.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7344: It’s just out of reach, elusive.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7345: It’s clever.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7346: A perverse game of hide and seek.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7347: Is this part of an attack, obfuscating the facts,

HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7349: It’s hard to tell. 
HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7350: I haven’t heard back from Darling.

HOTLINE_TRENCH_01_TRENCH_7359: To change things you have to break yourself.

HOTLINE_TRENCH_02_TRENCH_7433: Darling found a way to soothe this beast.

HOTLINE_TRENCH_02_TRENCH_7435: It’s my duty as the Director, like Northmoor before me.

HOTLINE_TRENCH_02_TRENCH_7437: I’ll damn well do it here. 
HOTLINE_TRENCH_02_TRENCH_7438: the Oldest House would swallow us alive.

HOTLINE_TRENCH_03_TRENCH_7411: It’s a secure line of communication with the Board.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_03_TRENCH_7412: They would tell me what I need to know.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_03_TRENCH_7413: Do I fear their answers?

HOTLINE_TRENCH_04_TRENCH_7885: and sometimes, successfully encouraged to appear and act as a convenient lock
HOTLINE_TRENCH_04_TRENCH_7886: Even Bureau veterans can only find one key in the Motel, 
HOTLINE_TRENCH_04_TRENCH_7887: The rest, the many other doors, are still mysteries to us.
HOTLINE_TRENCH_04_TRENCH_7888: We’re all merely guests there.

HOTLINE_TRENCH_04_TRENCH_7892: I guess that’s where the whiskey comes in.

M01_09_JESSE_237: I should’ve lied.
M01_09_JESSE_240: Call me Jesse.
M01_09_JESSE_243: Hiss?
M01_09_JESSE_245: [0.00-2.66]And just like that, my name for it is official.[2.96-6.61]The Hiss, like the sound of poison gas leaking in.
M01_09_JESSE_250: [0.15-0.96]Trench is dead.[2.09-2.55]Shot.
M01_09_JESSE_252: I found his body, and the gun.
M01_09_JESSE_253: Do I tell her it looked like a suicide?
M01_09_JESSE_255: [0.19-8.52]Also, and this can sound crazy - he keeps appearing to me, saying things.[11.40-14.79]It’s hard to make out, but he told me to cleanse the control point?[15.87-19.82]Push the Hiss out, the whole room shifted around.
M01_09_JESSE_257: I’m not ready to tell her about you yet.
M01_09_JESSE_258: A janitor let me in.
M01_09_JESSE_260: [0.29-1.41]Emily Pope.[2.90-5.00]I don’t know her, but I like her already.[5.99-10.63]She's the opposite of the faceless agency I’ve blamed for what happened to me for so long.[12.39-16.58]But I can’t trust her yet, or rather, the Bureau she’s a part of.
M01_09_JESSE_261: [0.09-0.58]Yes.[2.07-2.85]I can try.
M01_09_JESSE_262: [0.00-1.33]I’m speaking for you, of course.[2.63-3.80]We can try it together.
M01_09_POPE_2190: [0.89-3.65]But there’s something I need to ask you to do first.[4.34-12.18]If you can cleanse a control point, then you can maybe cure those infected, possessed, by the Hiss.[12.93-18.01]Because if that’s possible, our options are very different.
M01_09_POPE_2191: [0.42-4.83]Some of the people corrupted by the Hiss tend to float, I'm not sure why yet.[5.38-7.13]Try to cleanse one of them.
M01_09_POPE_2192: [0.44-2.37]I’ll start setting up a field lab in the Board Room.[2.77-5.33]Come find me once you cleanse one of the corrupted agents.
M01_09_POPE_228: [0.00-0.69]Hello?[2.33-3.19]Can you hear me?
M01_09_POPE_229: [0.03-0.86]Are you with us?[2.13-3.12]With the Bureau?[4.77-5.90]Are you still sane?
M01_09_POPE_230: [0.00-1.59]Please, talk to me.[2.77-4.94]We saw you deal with the...[5.90-7.49]compromised agents.
M01_09_POPE_231: Is it safe to come out?
M01_09_POPE_234: [0.03-1.26]The feeling’s mutual.[2.00-4.94]I’m Pope, Emily Pope, Dr. Darling’s assistant.
M01_09_POPE_238: [0.16-0.89]Shit![1.35-2.62]You’re the new director![3.48-4.08]Hold on.[4.38-5.32]We’re coming out.
M01_09_POPE_239: [0.03-0.69]Director...[1.23-1.69]Faden?
M01_09_POPE_241: [0.51-1.68]Okay, Jesse.[2.16-2.98]I’m Emily.
M01_09_POPE_242: Somehow this hostile force, this-
M01_09_POPE_244: [0.06-0.60]That works.[1.31-4.09]Somehow the Hiss managed to infiltrate the building without any warning.
M01_09_POPE_246: [0.22-1.87]We’re in full lockdown.[2.25-10.25]It seems to have spread everywhere and to everyone not protected by an HRA, and, extraordinarily, you.
M01_09_POPE_249: [0.23-3.90]You are the Director, and that makes you special by definition.[4.16-7.11]Trench is no longer the director, obviously.[8.21-8.76]I’m sorry.[8.88-9.97]I’m talking too much.[9.97-12.87]This whole situation is just a lot.
M01_09_POPE_251: Ah.
M01_09_POPE_254: The Service Weapon.
M01_09_POPE_256: [0.41-1.41]You did that?[1.94-6.58]And you entered the building when it was already in the lockdown, before you became the new director?[7.30-8.09]How?
M01_09_POPE_259: [0.14-1.26]I love it.[1.29-3.64]This is fucking unbelievable.[3.71-6.23]It’s- I can’t even-[7.52-13.23]Look, Jesse, I have a million questions, you probably have a million more.
M01_10_JESSE_263: [0.10-0.73]Okay.[1.37-1.95]You with me?[3.06-5.99]We did it before, pushed the Hiss out.
M01_11_JESSE_2193: [0.12-1.96]Emily said she’d be in the Board Room.[1.96-3.52]I need to talk to her.
M01_11_JESSE_267: [0.03-0.87]It didn’t work.[1.24-3.37]The Hiss has burrowed too deep.[4.15-6.80]Ripping it out rips them apart.
M01_11_JESSE_268: I need to talk to Emily.
M01_11_POPE_2194: [0.53-1.07]Jesse![1.13-1.81]Over here!
M01_11_POPE_2265: We need to make a plan, Jesse.
M01_12_JESSE_2249: I can’t cleanse them.
M01_12_JESSE_2251: [0.25-1.40]I’m gonna tell her why I’m here.[2.98-3.62]I’ll risk it.
M01_12_JESSE_2252: [0.22-9.32]Listen, the Bureau was involved in an incident in my home town, Ordinary, seventeen years ago.[10.42-12.58]The Bureau came in and covered the whole thing up.[14.36-16.72]I’ve been looking for this place for a long time.
M01_12_JESSE_2253: [0.29-0.94]That’s enough.[2.34-3.74]Maybe that’s too much already.[5.42-8.21]I can’t tell her about Dylan and the rest yet.
M01_12_JESSE_2257: [0.33-1.11]Trench...[1.78-4.68]the ghost or whatever he is...[4.75-10.02]he mentioned something called the Hotline, said I should find it.
M01_12_JESSE_2259: Where is the Hotline?
M01_12_JESSE_2263: [0.20-0.61]Okay.[1.22-2.32]That’s my next stop.
M01_12_JESSE_289: [0.10-2.08]You mentioned “the Oldest House”?[2.98-3.52]What is it?
M01_12_JESSE_291: [0.11-2.57]I’ve been to New York a few times.[3.82-5.23]How didn’t I notice this place?
M01_12_JESSE_293: So without you, I never would have found the front door.
M01_12_JESSE_294: Okay.
M01_12_JESSE_295: [0.03-1.09]This Trench guy.[1.77-3.33]I keep hearing him in my head.[4.42-5.40]Is he a ghost?[6.30-6.87]Haunting me?
M01_12_JESSE_298: I think I will, yeah.
M01_12_JESSE_299: You said you’re an assistant?
M01_12_JESSE_301: Emily really loves her job.
M01_12_OPTION1: Origin of the Hiss
M01_12_OPTION2: The Oldest House
M01_12_OPTION3: Director Trench
M01_12_OPTION4: Pope's Role
M01_12_OPTION5: End Conversation
M01_12_POPE_1802: [0.85-2.62]That's just a hypothesis on my part.[2.65-4.16]I’d need the gun to research it.[4.51-7.56]But you better hold on to that, given the circumstances.
M01_12_POPE_2250: [0.32-0.92]I saw.[2.26-3.16]It was worth a shot.[3.46-5.74]Thank you, Director. Jesse.
M01_12_POPE_2254: I’ve seen mentions of an Altered World Event case dealing with Ordinary.
M01_12_POPE_2255: [0.57-2.96]You were at ground zero as a child?[4.41-5.95]It was one of the big ones.[6.30-7.43]And before my time.
M01_12_POPE_2256: [0.51-2.18]And very classified.[2.74-5.21]I can try to dig out some old files for you.[5.93-8.15]My boss, Casper Darling, would know.[8.15-10.16]But he’s missing.[11.40-14.45]I think he knew this was coming, or suspected.[15.17-22.64]He came up with the HRAs, the Hedron Resonance Amplifiers, I think they're what saved us, or a few of us.[23.75-25.19]And Director Trench would know.
M01_12_POPE_2258: [0.44-4.88]It’s another Object of Power like the gun, an old Bakelite telephone, [4.90-9.35] a direct line of communication between the Director and the Board.[9.45-11.82]Maybe he can talk to you more clearly through that.[12.26-15.36]Trench has years and years of experience.[15.43-17.90]He might know how to destroy the Hiss.
M01_12_POPE_2260: [0.17-2.57]It’s kept in the Communications Department, through the Mail Room.[2.71-5.90]It’s part of this sector, so we can access it even with the lockdown in place.[6.51-7.96]We’ll get the door open for you.
M01_12_POPE_2261: [0.32-2.45]It’s kept in a chamber behind the Mail Room.[2.78-5.95]It’s part of this sector, so we can access it even with the lockdown in place.[6.23-7.61]We’ll get the door open for you.
M01_12_POPE_2262: [0.11-3.18]It’s kept past the Mail Room, in the Communications Department.[3.44-7.08]It’s part of this sector, so we can access it even with the lockdown in place.[7.47-8.87]We’ll get the door open for you.
M01_12_POPE_2264: [0.40-2.34]That’s Tommasi’s department.[2.34-3.78]He’s the Head of Communications.[4.26-6.11]I don’t think he had an HRA.[6.11-8.48]He kind of made a point about not wearing one earlier.[9.21-10.02]Keep an eye out.
M01_12_POPE_290: [0.12-4.65]This building, the Bureau headquarters, the Oldest House, is a shifting place.[5.11-5.78]You’ve seen it.[5.78-8.08]It transcends its physical limits.
M01_12_POPE_292: [0.30-1.83]It’s an attribute of the building.[2.26-3.76]This is a Place of Power.[3.93-5.56]The Oldest House doesn’t like attention.[5.61-7.90]So unless you are purposefully trying to find it, you don’t.[8.30-9.51]Which is perfect for us.[10.27-14.56]The work we do here is essential, but unstable.[14.92-20.52]The Bureau prefers not to be noticed and we need strong walls to make sure nothing gets out.
M01_12_POPE_296: [1.05-4.85]I doubt we’re talking about a ghost in the traditional sense.[5.22-6.48]But an echo, maybe.[7.01-10.30]See, if he was killed by the Service Weapon, your gun, [10.38-13.41]maybe it’s his final thoughts recorded by the bullet in his brain.[13.44-16.02]Like a deep space probe sending back data.
M01_12_POPE_300: [0.22-1.06]It’s just a title.[1.06-2.57]I’m a scientist, a researcher.[2.78-4.03]I work for Dr. Darling.[4.35-7.78]When Bureau agents go out in the field, the sites of Altered World Events, [7.79-10.63]we study the materials, the Altered Items, they bring back.[10.96-18.31]It’s always something we’ve never seen before, and studying them requires new instruments, methodology, sometimes entirely new fields of science.
M01_12_POPE_302: [0.06-2.08]See, there’s no guidebook for what we do here.[2.27-6.40]Everything that happens at the Bureau, including the science, is without precedent.
M01_13_JESSE_2238: Thanks, Emily.
M01_13_POPE_2235: [0.14-3.34]The door to the Comms Department is just outside the Board Room, back in the lobby.[3.70-5.02]They should’ve gotten it open by now.
M01_13_POPE_2236: [0.29-1.87]Follow the signs to the Mail Room.[1.87-4.24]You can get to the Hotline Containment Chamber through there.
M01_13_POPE_2237: [0.37-1.20]Good luck, Jesse.[1.47-3.05]See you back here once you have the Hotline.

M02_04_JESSE_327: Get the hell away from it!

M02_06_JESSE_2348: Emily said that the Hotline can be reached through the Mail Room.
M02_06_JESSE_340: [0.07-0.68]There you are.[1.46-3.39]You were gone, cut off.[4.89-7.65]I got it, just like you wanted, right?[7.65-9.04]This will help me fight the Hiss.
M02_06_JESSE_343: [0.21-1.67]Alberto Tommasi.[1.67-2.75]Head of Comms.[5.25-6.10]The Hiss got him.
M02_09_JESSE_354: Whoa!
M02_09_JESSE_355: [0.12-1.41]Have we been here before?[3.45-3.94]No.[5.70-12.41]I’ve stayed at a lot of roadside motels across the country, on the road, on the run, under the radar.[13.61-19.91]This feels like all of them, like something recognized from a dream.

M02_13_JESSE_365: [0.00-1.46]I have it, the Hotline.[2.02-3.18]I can reach Trench.[3.57-4.98]Well, listen to him.[5.75-7.92]He feels more like an echo.[8.49-10.96]An echo with important info.[12.05-13.32]I need to get back to Emily.
M02_13_JESSE_367: [0.00-4.21]People react... strongly when I tell them about you.[6.53-8.62]Is it too soon to tell Emily?[9.12-10.75]She might be able to help.
M02_14_JESSE_370: [0.15-0.70]Emily.[2.08-2.71]Let’s talk.
M02_14_POPE_368: [0.22-0.77]Jesse![1.03-2.10]Did you get the Hotline?[2.10-3.39]How is it out there, the Comms?[3.39-3.91]The Hiss?[4.99-5.54]Sorry.[6.00-6.53]You made it.[7.48-8.07]I’m glad.
M02_14_POPE_371: Of course.
M02_15_JESSE_372: [0.12-0.87]I got the Hotline.[1.24-2.62]I can make out what Trench is saying now.
M02_15_JESSE_374: [0.05-1.55]He talked about his management team.[2.01-3.90]People who knew the Bureau’s secrets.[4.47-6.13]Your boss, Darling.[6.47-10.01]Tommasi, but he’s gone, the Hiss got him.[10.98-11.66]Salvador?
M02_15_JESSE_376: And Marshall?
M02_15_JESSE_378: [1.25-2.30]Someone who could help us.[3.24-5.45]The other sectors, how do I get there?
M02_15_JESSE_380: We already got past one lockdown.
M02_15_JESSE_381: Maybe I can find a way.
M02_15_JESSE_383: [0.14-0.94]Tests?[2.38-3.17]I don’t know.[3.83-5.17]She might find out about you.[7.38-10.21]But I wouldn’t mind understanding more myself.
M02_15_JESSE_384: [0.17-0.64]Okay.[1.58-2.51]If you think it will help.
M02_15_JESSE_386: [0.25-2.14]And I’ll look for a way inside the Maintenance Sector.[2.78-5.29]The sooner we find one, the sooner I reach this override.
M02_15_POPE_3373: Normally, you’d take the Sector Elevator down there, it connects all the sectors, but it won’t work while the lockdown is in effect.
M02_15_POPE_373: [0.24-1.14]Incredible.[1.64-2.71]What did he say?
M02_15_POPE_375: He’s the Head of Security.
M02_15_POPE_377: [0.28-2.44]Helen Marshall is Head of Operations.[2.50-4.41]She’s tough, ex-CIA.[4.79-8.62]She took her rangers and went to the Research Sector to secure the HRA production.[9.18-10.22]She hasn’t come back.
M02_15_POPE_379: [0.22-2.67]It’s impossible because of the internal lockdown.[2.85-7.11]You can perform a Directorial Override to lift it, but that can only be done in the Maintenance Sector.
M02_15_POPE_382: [0.17-6.02]Jesse, look, with no prep, no training, in this extreme situation,[6.03-8.24]you are doing phenomenally well.[8.60-10.62]All that, and the Hiss can’t seem to affect you.[11.06-16.07]I would love to run some tests on you, if you agree that is.[16.70-18.85]We could find out something that would help us.
M02_15_POPE_385: [0.18-0.68]Great.[1.47-4.46]I’ll check the internal documentation for any lockdown bypasses.[4.76-7.71]We need to get these sectors open to locate Darling and Marshall.
M03: Directorial Override
M03_01_AHTI_2303: [0.46-2.11]Time to work.[2.51-5.50]Meet me in the Maintenance.
M03_01_JESSE_390: I’ll go look.
M03_01_JESSE_392: Like I said before, the janitor is a friendly face.
M03_01_POPE_389: [0.05-0.86]Do you hear that?[1.38-2.35]Someone’s singing?[3.24-4.29]Where’s it coming from?
M03_02_JESSE_3187: [0.03-2.49]The Maintenance Sector is the janitor’s domain.[3.39-7.76]If I can find Ahti here, he can help me reach the override.
M03_02_JESSE_3188: [0.44-3.84]The Directorial Override is right there, in the control room.[4.91-5.94]How do we get there?
M03_02_JESSE_393: [0.05-3.68]Maybe it was you who got me into the Oldest House with the lockdown on.[4.82-6.31]Maybe it was Ahti.[7.54-11.24]It felt like he made the elevator appear that took me to Trench's office.[12.97-14.40]Is Ahti guiding me too?
M03_02_JESSE_394: [0.07-1.95]Alarms and flashing lights.[2.94-3.71]Can’t be good.
M03_04_AHTI_1044: [0.04-2.67]It’s place for congratulations.[4.58-6.47]Jippii, saatana.
M03_04_AHTI_1045: [0.05-2.64]It happened in the last drop.[4.55-7.82]I truly need an assistant.
M03_04_AHTI_1046: Mä kyllä sanon perkele suoraan, että this house has a vermin problem, a bad one. 
M03_04_AHTI_1047: And the pensioner inside is starting to feel the band around his head tighten. 
M03_04_AHTI_1048: The situation needs to be fixed before the plant blows up and we all disappear like a fart in Sahara, perkele. 
M03_04_AHTI_1478: [0.22-1.94]But don’t worry at all.[2.02-6.80]You’ll take care of it, and soon this crisis gonna be last winter’s snow.
M03_04_AHTI_1480: [0.11-2.72]That's why you'll make a great assistant.[4.59-8.91]Very well, I'll hit the facts on the table.
M03_04_AHTI_1481: They've already messed up the cooling pumps and the power generators of power plant, perkele. 
M03_04_AHTI_1484: The door in the back leads to the plant. 
M03_04_AHTI_2304: The works on the task board here you can do later when you have time. 
M03_04_AHTI_395: [0.25-1.15]Well done.[2.01-3.16]You got the job.
M03_04_AHTI_398: [0.08-1.68]Yes, yes.[1.84-3.05]Easy peasy.[3.92-6.19]It’s just around the corner.[7.89-12.51]But first we need to get you working![13.68-17.10]Very small couple of hours job.
M03_04_AHTI_400: [0.06-4.95]Jahaa, jaa-a, you think there’s a dog buried in this?[5.43-8.72]I can tell you are not a yesterday’s grouse’s son.
M03_04_AHTI_402: [0.81-5.16]But don’t you worry, I’ve left you clear instructions.[6.15-9.98]You’ll catch the end of the thread before I go to my vacation.
M03_04_AHTI_404: [0.13-0.60]Yes.[0.78-3.41]No-one’s gonna cancel my holiday, or sheaths gonna rattle.
M03_04_AHTI_405: You better go now so you don’t have to run with your head as your third leg. 
M03_04_JESSE_3189: [0.33-2.42]Yeah, hi Ahti.[2.45-5.27]Look we need to get the lockdown lifted.[5.34-7.15]Otherwise, I can’t get to the other sectors.[7.83-9.35]Can you help me get to the override?
M03_04_JESSE_396: [0.03-2.64]Funny thing is, I’ve been a janitor.[3.70-5.97]I’m more at home in that role than as the director.[7.82-10.08]Only Ahti here seems to see that.
M03_04_JESSE_399: Something tells me it’s gonna be more than that.
M03_04_JESSE_401: [0.08-2.59]Trying my best to keep up with this.[2.98-9.03]Fix the coolant pumps, and the power generators, otherwise the power plant will blow?
M03_04_JESSE_403: [0.10-1.03]Vacation?[2.00-2.82]Right.
M03_04_JESSE_406: [0.05-1.33]The door in the back?[2.13-2.69]That’s great.[3.38-4.22]Thank you, Ahti.
M03_05_AHTI_2305: [0.39-2.10]Work for the Janitor.[2.38-3.13]It's broke.[3.49-4.56]Need to fix it.
M03_05_JESSE_3190: Ahti?
M03_05_JESSE_410: Okay, so what happens again if that thing blows up?
M03_06_ARISH_1120: [0.35-0.82]Sorry.[1.32-2.00]Bureau jargon.[2.41-5.48]It’s what we call the power plant: you know, the big rumbling metal thing.[6.75-9.91]Salvador, Head of Security, asked me to protect it in case of an attack.[10.26-11.93]See, what’s inside is dangerous.[12.81-14.71]Dr. Darling seemed to know it’d be a target.
M03_06_ARISH_411: [0.62-0.94]Ma’am.[1.23-1.58]Hey![2.40-4.03]Chief Arish, FBC Security.[4.03-5.63]Shouldn’t you be in a safe room?
M03_06_ARISH_414: [0.06-2.17]Yeah, yeah, Chief Arish, FBC Security, I'm just-[3.61-4.97]Oh, hang on, you’re the new director.[5.36-7.12]It's a pleasure.[7.84-8.30]Ma’am.
M03_06_ARISH_416: [0.57-3.41]Right, Faden, ma’am.[4.50-7.63]Look, as you can probably tell, it’s a bit of a shitshow down here.[8.13-9.43]We’ve been holding our ground,[9.43-12.77]but whatever’s gotten into our buddies has them wrecking the coolant pumps and the power converters.[13.33-18.13]The NSC keeps overheating and my crews keep getting shot before they have a chance to make any repairs.
M03_06_ARISH_419: [0.12-2.58]No, he came down a few days ago, before everything went to hell.[3.31-5.01]He was out of it and smelled like a barmat.[5.01-11.40]He was ranting about vulnerabilities and how he only had one “large scale HRA”, but that he needed it somewhere else.[12.26-15.03]Still, at least he gave us these personal HRAs before he left.[15.74-17.89]Hey, did I mention that he was tearing his clothes off?[18.71-19.65]Crazy dude.
M03_06_ARISH_425: [0.28-3.62]Listen, I love playing 20 questions as much as the next guy,[3.62-7.50]but we have got to get the water and electrical systems repaired before this baby blows.[8.01-9.81]I'll have my guys unlock the doors out of here for you.
M03_06_ARISH_427: [0.32-0.78]The Hiss?[1.20-2.56]That's what we're calling 'em?[2.56-3.11]That's catchy.[4.12-7.34]Listen, the radios aren’t working so if you find my boss Salvador out there,[7.34-9.05]could you please ask him what the plan is?[9.69-11.42]I’m sure he will have one by now.
M03_06_JESSE_1119: NSC?
M03_06_JESSE_2323: He sure has a lot faith in his boss.
M03_06_JESSE_2324: I’ll keep an eye out for him.
M03_06_JESSE_412: [0.15-1.61]They all have HRAs.[3.15-4.21]We’re on the same side.
M03_06_JESSE_413: [0.09-1.39]My name is Jesse Faden.[2.06-5.04]I’m here to perform the Directorial Override to get the lockdown lifted.
M03_06_JESSE_415: Let’s skip the formalities, please.
M03_06_JESSE_418: [0.06-0.66]Darling?[0.96-1.48]He’s here?
M03_06_JESSE_424: Darling knew the Hiss was coming.
M03_06_JESSE_426: [0.25-1.00]I’ll take care of it.[1.51-3.98]You stay and keep the Hiss away from the plant if you can.
M03_06_JESSE_428: Try to stay alive.
M03_08A_AHTI_1989: [0.31-2.70]Blocking the pipes and the waterflow to the pumps.[3.52-4.88]You need to deal with it.
M03_08A_AHTI_1990: [0.22-5.23]We got him caught with his hand in the fish trap.[6.12-7.41]Get rid of him.
M03_08A_AHTI_2306: [0.26-1.20]Power cut.[1.86-3.41]Replace the parts.
M03_08A_AHTI_2307: [0.26-1.92]Pumps are busted.[2.20-4.72]You must fix the electricity.
M03_08A_AHTI_2308: [0.53-4.48]My old enemy, the Clog, is blocking the pipes.[4.96-7.25]You need to deal with that shit.
M03_08A_AHTI_2309: [0.13-3.83]He's very clever, he's trying to sneak in.[4.52-8.18]We got him caught with his hand in the fish trap.[8.76-9.99]Get rid of him.
M03_08A_AHTI_431: He’s my very old enemy, the clog, Paska. 
M03_08A_AHTI_433: [0.08-0.49]Yes![0.85-1.47]That’s it!
M03_08A_AHTI_434: He’s very clever, he sees we have our hands full now, he’s trying to sneak in. 
M03_08A_JESSE_3191: What the hell is that?!
M03_08A_JESSE_3192: That’s the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen.
M03_08A_JESSE_3193: The last pump’s up and running. 
M03_08A_JESSE_3194: Now let’s take care of the power.
M03_08A_JESSE_430: [0.07-0.70]Shit.[0.97-1.70]What now?
M03_08A_JESSE_432: [0.00-1.72]The Clog is blocking the pipes?[2.01-2.58]Is that it?
M03_08A_JESSE_436: [0.04-0.46]Okay.[0.74-2.06]We’re dealing with a blocked pipe here.[2.78-3.60]I can handle it.
M03_08A_JESSE_437: I can’t handle it.
M03_08A_JESSE_438: [0.04-0.91]There go the pipes.[1.59-3.81]Nothing more satisfying than manual labor.
M03_08A_JESSE_439: Let’s just get this done without blowing up the whole house.
M03_08B_AHTI_2310: [0.31-0.70]Broke.[1.63-2.55]Gone to shit.[3.08-4.33]Fix it fast.[4.97-9.43]If the plant goes boom, we can throw the spoon in the corner.
M03_08B_AHTI_2311: [0.48-1.60]It's fried up.[2.14-6.81]You need to fix it before the old twig-pants inside the plant has a shit fit.
M03_08B_JESSE_3195: Power fixed.
M03_08B_JESSE_3196: Now let’s fix the pumps and water flow.
M03_12_JESSE_444: This is what we came here to do.
M03_13_JESSE_451: [0.34-0.87]That’s it.[1.22-2.67]The other sectors should be open now.[4.54-7.47]I think it’s time I told Emily why I’m here.[8.46-9.28]I’ll risk it.[10.86-12.51]You two should get to know each other.
M03_14_JESSE_2267: Let’s hope you two get along.
M03_14_JESSE_2268: So, Marshall seems like our best lead on Dylan.
M03_14_JESSE_453: Let’s talk, Emily.
M03_14_JESSE_455: Listen, Emily...
M03_14_JESSE_456: [0.42-0.96]Screw it.[1.30-1.89]Just tell her.
M03_14_JESSE_458: [0.64-2.85]I haven’t been completely honest.[5.14-6.14]I have a younger brother.[6.98-7.43]Dylan.[8.86-12.62]When we were kids, we found an old slide projector in Ordinary’s landfill.[13.72-15.17]The slides created...[16.77-19.07]doorways to other places.[21.46-22.72]Bad things happened...[24.58-25.19]came through.
M03_14_JESSE_462: [0.27-1.16]That’s all she gets.[2.56-4.37]The rest stays locked inside.
M03_14_JESSE_463: [0.88-1.88]But we found help.[3.41-10.53]Through one of the doorways we met something, a being.
M03_14_JESSE_466: [0.00-1.47]It’s hard to describe.[1.94-2.33]But it...[4.67-5.72]she helped us.
M03_14_JESSE_468: [0.18-2.42]We managed to turn the projector off.[2.99-7.20]The bad things that came through the doorways were gone.
M03_14_JESSE_469: [0.20-3.49]After that, your people came, tried to grab us.[5.02-5.84]I ran away.[8.45-9.29]They got Dylan.
M03_14_JESSE_470: I left him behind.
M03_14_JESSE_472: [0.18-0.63]Yes.[2.13-2.97]You covered it up.[4.92-6.14]No one believed me.[9.36-10.72]I just want to find Dylan.[11.91-13.55]I’ve been looking for him ever since.
M03_14_JESSE_477: I thought you took it, the Bureau, along with Dylan.
M03_14_JESSE_480: [0.17-4.69]She’s been with me ever since Ordinary, in my head.[6.51-7.39]She led me to you.[9.60-11.78]I call her Polaris.
M03_14_JESSE_485: [0.00-0.58]Dylan?[1.20-1.86]Is that Dylan?
M03_14_JESSE_487: [0.12-1.17]I need to go after her.[2.11-3.77]How can I get to the Research Sector?
M03_14_POPE_3415: [0.26-3.10]A large area of the Containment Sector was reserved for it.[3.64-5.64]The case hasn’t been active for a long time.[5.71-8.26]I have no idea if anything’s still there.
M03_14_POPE_3416: [0.75-3.89]Which may help explain your test results.[4.32-7.48]Your readings are incredible, Jesse.[8.04-12.61]Now, cross-referencing them with the database, I found two matches in Darling’s old classified files.
M03_14_POPE_3417: [0.53-3.96]Unfortunately, I can’t access them, beyond the file codes.[4.21-9.47]But one was “P6”, referring to a prime candidate for a potential future Bureau director.[10.04-11.43]This was logged years ago.
M03_14_POPE_452: [0.26-1.72]Jesse, you made it.[2.11-3.81]And you lifted the internal lockdown.
M03_14_POPE_454: Yes, of course. 
M03_14_POPE_464: [0.78-1.38]A being?[2.24-3.49]What kind of a being?
M03_14_POPE_471: Bureau Agents took your brother?
M03_14_POPE_476: [0.17-1.96]What happened to the slide projector?[2.42-4.34]It sounds like another Object of Power.
M03_14_POPE_478: [0.18-1.77]I’ve never heard of it.[2.24-4.88]But around here, assume everything’s classified.[5.50-8.80]I looked into the Ordinary AWE case files after you mentioned it.[9.20-11.98]Trench and Darling were both involved.
M03_14_POPE_479: Can you tell me more about this “being” you found?
M03_14_POPE_483: [0.21-1.98]As in a guiding star?[3.37-5.48]Did Polaris know about the Hiss?[6.54-12.23]If she got you in here, in spite of the lockdown, she’s very powerful.
M03_14_POPE_486: [0.28-2.78]The other match is on something called “Hedron”,[2.79-6.34]which must be connected to these Hedron Resonance Amplifiers somehow.[6.79-11.05]All I know is that Marshall went to the Research Sector to secure the HRA production[11.06-12.48]after the Hiss first attacked.
M03_14_POPE_488: [0.25-1.26]Use my keycard.[1.35-2.95]The Sector Elevator will take you there.
M03_Step_00: Search for a way into the Maintenance Sector
M03_Step_00_LOG: The Internal Lockdown – an emergency security measure – is stopping Jesse from looking for Trench’s missing management team in the other sectors. Jesse sets out to enter the Maintenance Sector to find the Directorial Override and lift the Internal Lockdown. 
M03_Step_01: Find Ahti the Janitor
M03_Step_01_LOG: With Ahti’s help, Jesse reaches the Maintenance Sector, where the Internal Lockdown can be lifted. 
M03_Step_02: Find a way to fix the NSC Power Plant
M03_Step_03: Speak with Security Chief Arish in the Security Booth
M03_Step_04: Fix the NSC Coolant Pumps
M03_Step_05: Investigate what is blocking the pipe
M03_Step_06: Fix the NSC Energy Converters
M03_Step_07: Lift the Internal Lockdown using the Directorial Override
M03_Step_07_LOG: She helps Chief of Security Arish to stabilize the overloading NSC Power Plant before performing the Directorial Override and unlocking the Sector Elevator. 
M03_Step_08: Speak with Emily
M03_Step_08_LOG_COMPLETE: Jesse reveals to Pope that she came here to find her younger brother, Dylan, who was taken as a child by Bureau agents. Years ago, Jesse and Dylan were involved in an Altered World Event in their hometown of Ordinary. Ever since then, an entity Jesse calls Polaris has guided her. Polaris led her to the Oldest House.
M04_03_JESSE_499: [0.07-0.83]She’s in trouble.[1.81-2.69]I need to reach her.
M04_03_MARSHALL_498: [0.04-0.37]Pryce![0.60-1.31]Come in, Pryce![1.57-2.65]This is Marshall, we need-
M04_09_JESSE_510: [0.06-0.65]Marshall?[0.92-1.79]Are you still there?
M04_09_JESSE_511: [0.12-1.17]We’re so close.[2.07-2.89]We need to hurry.
M04_09_MARSHALL_509: [0.03-1.13]Someone answer, damn it![1.16-2.44]We need backup down here.
M04_11_JESSE_2328: She’s got that right.
M04_11_JESSE_515: Marshall, can you hear me?
M04_11_JESSE_517: [0.08-1.48]My name is Jesse Faden.[1.96-2.81]I’m coming to help.
M04_11_MARSHALL_514: [0.03-3.48]If anyone is listening, we’ve encountered heavy resistance.[3.70-5.51]We've fallen back to the Luck Department.[5.58-8.04]All agents are ordered to converge here.
M04_11_MARSHALL_516: [0.00-1.16]Yes, I can hear you.[1.19-1.87]Who is this?
M04_11_MARSHALL_518: Faden?
M04_11_MARSHALL_519: [0.00-1.78]Hold on, I’m sending the elevator for you.[1.81-2.56]We need to talk.
M04_12_JESSE_522: [0.00-2.54]Trench said his team knows all the Bureau’s secrets.[2.70-4.13]Marshall especially.[4.58-6.16]Does she know what happened to Dylan?
M04_13_JESSE_2035: [0.11-1.58]None of this fazes her?[2.95-3.54]Really?
M04_13_JESSE_529: [0.09-1.04]Just call me Jesse.[1.82-3.09]Trench told me to find you.[3.09-4.08]He said you could help.
M04_13_JESSE_532: [0.17-2.44]At least she seems to know what’s going on here.[3.86-5.74]She could know about Dylan.
M04_13_JESSE_533: [0.23-1.31]I can clear out the Hiss.[1.77-2.73]I’ll be your firepower.
M04_13_JESSE_535: Is she testing me?
M04_13_MARSHALL_523: [0.14-0.76]There you are.[1.15-2.18]I was starting to worry.
M04_13_MARSHALL_524: [0.16-2.72]Congratulations on your appointment, Director Faden.[3.59-6.45]I'm Helen Marshall, Head of Bureau Operations.
M04_13_MARSHALL_526: Zachariah’s dead then, and I assume you found his gun.
M04_13_MARSHALL_530: [0.13-1.78]And he told you this through the Hotline?[2.33-3.13]Makes sense.
M04_13_MARSHALL_531: [0.21-4.16]Here’s the situation: Darling created the HRAs in a lab nearby.[4.22-6.22]We need more if we’re going to survive this attack.[6.57-9.26]My rangers can’t secure the lab alone, not against those things.[9.33-10.46]We need more firepower.
M04_13_MARSHALL_534: That's a good answer.
M04_13_MARSHALL_536: [0.00-2.38]Darling has systems in place to protect his labs.[2.83-4.27]This should help you get past them.[4.87-6.68]We’ll talk more after you clear out the Hiss.
M04_13_MARSHALL_537: [0.23-1.85]Rangers, let her through.[2.95-4.46]We’ll have to lock the door behind you.[5.03-6.75]Sorry, but we can’t risk a breach.
M04_14_JESSE_3197: Shit!
M04_14_JESSE_3198: What is THAT!
M04_14_JESSE_3199: What the hell?
M04_14_JESSE_3200: What now?!
M04_14_JESSE_3201: Oh no!
M04_14_JESSE_3202: Oh hell!
M04_14_JESSE_3203: Oh shit!
M04_14_JESSE_3204: Fuck!
M04_14_JESSE_3205: Damn!
M04_15_JESSE_540: [0.03-0.93]This way to the lab?[2.23-2.54]Okay.[4.04-5.53]You must like these HRAs.
M04_15_JESSE_541: [0.13-4.51]Sounds like Darling built them, and most of the things around here.[6.04-10.19]If Marshall can’t help us with Dylan, he’s our next best bet.[11.49-16.96]Assuming he’s not dead, or taken over by the Hiss.
M04_16_JESSE_2327: She's not much of a conversationalist, huh?
M04_16_JESSE_542: You led me here, any idea how to make it work?
M04_16_JESSE_546: I’ve replaced a couple spark plugs, but this looks a bit more complicated.
M04_16_JESSE_547: I’ll see what I can do.
M04_16_MARSHALL_543: [0.23-1.26]Hello again, Director.[1.59-3.02]It appears we have a new problem.[3.35-5.32]We need to get the HRA machine working.
M04_16_MARSHALL_545: [0.45-2.70]Last time I saw Darling, he gave me this punch card.[3.43-4.71]He said I would need it for this.[4.97-5.26]Here.
M04_17_MARSHALL_2039: So, we need to find all the punchcards.
M04_17_MARSHALL_2040: Have you checked the upper floor?
M04_17_MARSHALL_2041: Each punchcard should correspond to a terminal.
M04_17_MARSHALL_2042: These whiteboard drawings may be important.
M04_17_MARSHALL_2043: It looks like he was working on something to do with these symbols.
M04_17_MARSHALL_2044: What do the symbols mean?
M04_17_MARSHALL_2045: What do these whiteboards mean?
M04_17_MARSHALL_2046: [0.10-1.60]Try different combinations.[1.75-3.09]One of them has to work.
M04_17_MARSHALL_2047: [0.03-1.75]Darling must've had a system.[2.06-3.87]Randomness isn’t in his nature.
M04_17_MARSHALL_2048: [0.07-2.73]The punchcards, the symbols, the terminals.[3.16-4.24]How do they connect?
M04_18_MARSHALL_549: [0.05-1.02]The Prism shattered.[1.69-3.83]Darling's prototypes have a lot of issues.[4.05-5.11]We need a new plan.
M04_19_JESSE_2037: [0.08-1.55]But don't call me Director.[2.68-3.70]Jesse is fine.
M04_19_JESSE_553: [0.09-1.47]I’ve been to Maintenance already.[1.73-2.62]I can find my way.
M04_19_JESSE_554: [0.27-1.69]But how long will that take?[2.21-3.92]Nothing here is simple.[4.99-7.43]I need to ask her now, before I go.
M04_19_JESSE_555: [0.20-1.56]I need something from you first.[2.74-4.80]What do you know about Dylan Faden?
M04_19_JESSE_559: [0.29-4.99]She’s right, as much as I don’t want to admit it.[4.99-6.63]I‘m the only one who can help.
M04_19_JESSE_560: Fine, I'll get the Prisms first.
M04_19_JESSE_561: Dylan will have to wait just a little longer.
M04_19_JESSE_565: [0.23-0.74]Thanks.[2.21-4.45]Emily Pope has set up a base in Executive.[5.00-7.11]Once I have the Prism, I’ll meet you there.
M04_19_MARSHALL_1992: [0.06-2.80]We need more Black Rock Prisms to make this machine work.[3.24-6.69]Darling has another lab down in the Black Rock Processing site in Maintenance.[7.02-8.79]That must be where he keeps the Prisms.
M04_19_MARSHALL_1993: [0.61-1.55]I knew this was coming.[2.87-6.71]Lives are at stake here, and we need this machine working to save those lives.[7.04-9.97]Once that is done, Director Faden, then we can talk.
M04_19_MARSHALL_563: [0.53-1.47]I’ll call you Faden.[2.20-3.53]Here, you’ll need this Keycard.
M04_19_MARSHALL_566: [0.55-1.05]Right.[1.68-2.77]I’ll move out immediately.
M04_20_JESSE_3206: [0.12-2.57]We need to get back to Maintenance and find a Black Rock Prism.[3.05-4.14]The rest comes after.
M04_20_MARSHALL_2051: Here, this will lead back to Central Research.
M04_20_MARSHALL_2052: Here, this will lead back to the Research Lobby.
M04_STEP_00: Find Marshall

M04_Title: Old Boys’ Club
M05: Threshold
M05_01_JESSE_3207: [0.15-0.57]Okay.[0.85-3.07]We need to find a way to Black Rock Processing.[3.39-5.24]That’s where Marshall said we’d find a Prism.
M05_01_JESSE_574: [0.47-2.40]Marshall knows something about Dylan.[3.14-3.99]Is he here?[3.99-4.93]Is he all right?[6.36-7.83]HRAs first.[8.49-13.19]They’ll help save everyone, including Dylan, once I find him.[14.88-18.47]Can you keep him safe, like you do with me?
M05_08_ARISH_578: [0.08-0.87]Hey, Faden![0.87-1.40]Up here!
M05_08_ARISH_579: I'm glad to see you’re still you. 
M05_08_ARISH_580: [0.14-1.32]Thanks for bringing down that...[2.49-3.55]whatever the fuck that was.[4.79-6.46]We are barely holding on here, boss.[7.14-8.60]How’s the situation outside Maintenance?
M05_08_ARISH_583: [0.73-4.02]So to recap: death, disaster and imminent destruction.[4.71-5.86]Another day at the FBC.[6.71-9.07]Darling’s lab is just past Black Rock Processing, [9.08-11.40]but I got good news and I got bad news on that front.[11.98-13.61]The good news is it’s right down the hall.[13.95-17.33]The bad news is a Hiss monster has decided to move in, so that's great.
M05_08_ARISH_586: [0.30-1.36]That’s what the Rangers said.[2.06-3.13]The ones that survived, anyway.[4.35-7.40]We are just treading water here and the Hiss keep coming.[8.46-13.55]Salvador would know what to do but apparently he took a security team into the Containment Sector just before the lockdown happened and-[14.27-15.20]Well, no-one’s seen him since.[16.06-17.87]But hey, at least we’ve got you.[18.50-19.44]Our fearless leader.
M05_08_ARISH_590: [0.51-1.18]Aye aye, Faden.[1.78-3.44]And be sure to put a bullet in that thing for me.
M05_08_JESSE_2326: [0.00-2.01]You’ve done a good job here, Arish,[2.03-5.40]but you should take your people and get to the base in Executive.[6.11-7.07]You can regroup there.[8.57-10.02]I’ll go deal with this monster.[11.34-12.55]I'm getting kind of used to them.
M05_08_JESSE_581: [0.00-0.90]What do I tell him?[1.58-5.75]The truth is harsh, but these people seem familiar with death.
M05_08_JESSE_582: [0.21-1.38]The Hiss are everywhere.[1.88-3.42]Most of the Bureau is lost.[3.99-7.89]We need Black Rock Prism to make more HRAs for any survivors in the Safe Rooms.[8.78-10.56]I’m here to check Darling’s Black Rock lab.
M05_08_JESSE_585: Monster?
M05_08_JESSE_587: [0.03-1.14]They shouldn’t rely on me.[2.21-3.11]They don’t know me.[5.13-7.14]They don’t know how I fail people.
M05_09_JESSE_591: [0.25-4.48]You showed me the HRA when I first got here, and the machine that makes them.[6.22-7.76]Can you help me find a Prism?
M05_09_JESSE_592: [0.07-1.03]Shiiiit.[1.85-2.78]They’re shattered.[3.73-5.30]Not a single Prism left.
M05_10_JESSE_598: [0.00-1.53]You heard that too, right?[2.54-4.74]Black Rock comes from a Threshold.[5.23-5.92]The Quarry.[7.03-9.60]So the Prisms must be there too.
M05_11_JESSE_599: [0.00-5.22]Everything here is crazy, weird, but it feels...[6.35-6.95]right.[7.40-9.50]Like how the world should be.[10.54-16.75]I am in an infinite building leading to different dimensions, and I never wanna leave.[18.05-22.04]Even with all the horror, I’m happy.[23.76-25.19]It feels sane.[26.66-30.12]Or just the right kind of insane.
M05_15_JESSE_602: [0.03-2.25]And there it is, right where you led me.[3.27-6.69]The HRAs, the Prisms, they mean something to you.
M05_15_JESSE_603: [0.03-2.45]I need to get this Prism to Marshall before it’s too late.[3.45-6.28]HRAs, then Dylan.
M05_16_JESSE_2038: There's that Marshall charm. 
M05_16_JESSE_2322: [0.44-1.09]I’m going.[2.58-3.07]Now.
M05_16_JESSE_605: [0.23-3.75]Had to take a detour into the Quarry, but I found plenty.[5.35-5.67]Here.
M05_16_JESSE_612: [0.18-1.05]This is it.[2.71-3.43]She knows.[4.93-7.42]Seventeen years I’ve waited.
M05_16_JESSE_614: [0.24-1.58]Of course he did.[3.15-4.69]We found you together.[4.69-6.31]We share a bond.[9.37-10.53]Are you with him now?
M05_16_JESSE_615: So you kidnapped him.
M05_16_JESSE_618: [0.04-1.23]Did you know about this?[2.05-3.87]Is this why you didn’t bring me here sooner?[3.87-5.17]Were you keeping me away?
M05_16_JESSE_619: Where is Dylan?
M05_16_JESSE_623: [0.04-0.87]My brother.[2.77-4.22]I thought we were the same.
M05_16_JESSE_624: What if we are?
M05_16_JESSE_627: [0.06-2.70]How do I make her stop calling me that?[3.67-4.88]I’m not here for them.
M05_16_MARSHALL_604: [0.10-0.58]Faden.[0.85-1.70]Did you find a Prism?
M05_16_MARSHALL_606: We will restart HRA production immediately.
M05_16_MARSHALL_611: I promised I’d tell you about Dylan once you helped us.
M05_16_MARSHALL_613: [0.12-1.64]Your brother is here.[2.63-6.53]He was once known as Prime Candidate 6, codename P6.[7.02-9.24]We brought him here after the Ordinary event.
M05_16_MARSHALL_616: [0.35-1.76]We took him in.[2.39-5.77]Your parents vanished along with every other adult in Ordinary.[6.45-8.61]Eventually his power changed him.[9.20-10.35]There were casualties.[10.86-12.91]He wasn’t fit to be the Director.
M05_16_MARSHALL_620: He’s kept in the Containment Sector, in the Panopticon. 
M05_16_MARSHALL_626: [0.49-1.59]I expected as much.[2.67-4.08]I need to go check on something.[4.80-6.95]Something I cannot let the Hiss find.[7.80-9.25]It shouldn’t take long, but...[9.52-11.62]you must watch the Bureau while I’m gone.[12.97-16.29]And remember: Dylan is dangerous.[17.78-20.57]Do not let him out, Director Faden.
M05_16_MARSHALL_7061: [0.06-2.17]He was groomed to be the future Director.[2.60-5.86]He had talents far beyond any other candidate in the program.
M05_Step_00: Search for Black Rock Processing

M06_01_JESSE_1669: [0.06-2.99]It's been a long time since Dylan and I knew each other.[3.64-5.10]I've wondered about him.[5.77-7.98]What kind of man he’d grow up to be.[8.59-11.98]Were things as hard for him as they were for me?
M06_01_JESSE_1670: Maybe in here, they were even harder.
M06_05_JESSE_1674: [0.27-2.46]P6 is what the Bureau calls Dylan.[2.95-4.21]His cell’s been breached.[5.47-6.45]Has the Hiss found him?[7.09-7.96]Are you there with him?[7.96-8.79]Can you protect him?
M06_10_JESSE_958: [0.30-2.14]I’m Jesse, the new Director.[3.16-4.17]I need to get inside.
M06_10_JESSE_962: We don’t have time for this.
M06_10_JESSE_963: [0.12-2.13]I was told Dylan Faden was kept here.[2.82-3.78]Can you help me find him?
M06_10_JESSE_966: Dylan’s in there.
M06_10_JESSE_967: [0.33-1.53]Open the door, Langston.[2.10-2.77]I’ll handle it.
M06_10_JESSE_970: Thanks, Langston.
M06_10_LANGSTON_1998: [0.09-2.99]But there’s currently a, uh, a pressing matter, ma’am.[2.99-6.83]We’ve got an Object of Power loose in there, it's wrecking the place.[6.83-8.12]The Benicoff TV.[8.13-10.22]It's a, uh, it's a real doozy.
M06_10_LANGSTON_1999: [0.10-4.44]This is a category five O.o.P we’re talking about and if we don’t contain it soon, [4.45-6.10]it will tear the Panopticon apart.[6.32-9.01]And we don’t want all those Altered Items getting loose, ma’am.[9.32-9.86]No, trust me.
M06_10_LANGSTON_3478: [0.48-2.49]Oh, Christ, lady, you scared me![3.31-4.84]Something I can help you with?
M06_10_LANGSTON_3479: Is there something I can help you with?
M06_10_LANGSTON_7239: Oh, hello.
M06_10_LANGSTON_959: [0.00-0.90]New Director?[1.92-7.17]Right uh, well okay, hello, I’m Frederick Langston, the Panopticon Supervisor.
M06_10_LANGSTON_960: [0.00-1.73]It’s not the best time for a tour.[1.73-6.31]We have Hiss everywhere, numerous cell breaches, and system failures across the board,[6.43-9.63]but you’re the Director, so here we go.
M06_10_LANGSTON_961: Founded by Zachariah Trench, the Panopticon is our state-of-the-art repository for all Altered Items, Objects of Power, and-
M06_10_LANGSTON_964: [0.00-2.77]Faden? Sure. [3.49-8.80]Darling wanted him somewhere secure and isolated, away from people. He’s in the maximum security cells, upper level.
M06_10_LANGSTON_965: Salvador took a team in to handle it, but no one’s heard from them for hours.
M06_10_LANGSTON_968: [0.03-1.01]If you say so.[1.26-7.00]I usually tell first timers not to touch anything, so, uh, just do that.[7.45-8.88]Here, I’ll get the door for you.
M06_10_LANGSTON_969: And please, ma’am, call me Fred.
M06_13_JESSE_1694: [0.08-3.62]Something went wrong with the Bureau's plan to make Dylan the next Director.[4.65-11.02]Marshall made it sound like it was all Dylan’s fault, but how much of it was what the Bureau did to him?[12.55-14.36]I don’t think she’s telling me everything.
M06_17_JESSE_1695: [0.00-3.75]That... thing was Salvador, the Head of Security.[4.14-6.72]His team didn’t stand a chance against the Hiss.
M06_17_JESSE_1696: No one here does.
M06_18_JESSE_1697: [0.47-2.57]Okay, the TV.[3.59-5.66]Another Object of Power gone nuts.
M06_18_JESSE_1698: Here we go again.
M06_20_JESSE_1700: [0.65-1.97]I can fly now.[3.11-3.82]Shit.
M06_20_JESSE_1701: [0.22-2.69]Now I can get to the upper levels of the Panopticon.[3.54-4.82]I can get to Dylan.
M06_20_JESSE_3208: [0.15-0.49]Okay.[1.20-2.30]Dealt with the TV.[3.34-4.59]Now I can find Dylan.
M06_21_JESSE_3209: Shit.
M06_21_JESSE_3210: Damn it.
M06_21_JESSE_3211: Not good.
M06_21_JESSE_3212: Dylan.

M06_STEP_04: Subdue the Benicoff TV Object of Power - 4th Floor
M06_STEP_04_LOG: She is let into the Panopticon, a secure containment facility for dangerous paranatural objects, by Frederick Langston, the Panopticon Supervisor.

M06_STEP_08_LOG_COMPLETE: Using this power, Jesse reaches Dylan’s cell on the top floor. There, Jesse finds an empty room, with signs of a deadly struggle. Pope contacts her via an intercom: Dylan has just entered Central Executive. 
M07: The Face of the Enemy
M07_01_JESSE_3213: [0.34-1.12]How is he?[2.62-3.37]I need to know.
M07_01_JESSE_3214: [0.05-0.78]How is he?[2.70-3.63]Don’t sugar coat it.
M07_01_JESSE_938: [0.62-3.56]It’s happening, after all these years.[3.61-4.84]Dylan is here.[6.88-7.93]But am I too late?
M07_01_JESSE_941: I want to see him.
M07_01_JESSE_942: [0.10-0.90]My brother...[2.22-3.18]or is he?
M07_01_JESSE_944: [0.06-0.47]Okay.[0.61-1.20]I need to go.
M07_01_POPE_935: [0.18-0.66]Jesse![0.93-1.63]You’re here.
M07_01_POPE_936: We should talk this through, how to proceed with Dylan.
M07_01_POPE_937: It’s pretty incredible, Jesse.
M07_01_POPE_939: [0.34-1.99]He’s clearly been affected by the Hiss.[2.02-4.76]But it’s different than the any other manifestation we’ve recorded.[5.34-7.75]Maybe what makes you so special is genetic.[8.17-9.65]He was a prime candidate.[9.83-11.87]Or maybe it's Polaris, protecting him?[11.87-13.58]Something else affecting the situation?
M07_01_POPE_940: [0.17-1.88]I need to run tests.[1.96-6.06]He seems more in control, more present.
M07_01_POPE_943: [0.60-1.33]Of course.[2.13-4.57]Marshall set up an HRA warded cage to contain him.[4.57-6.18]It’s on the upper floor, up the stairs.
M07_01_POPE_945: Jesse, be careful.
M07_03_DYLAN_646: You are Dylan Faden’s sister.
M07_03_DYLAN_649: [0.00-1.11]Not Dylan.[2.29-4.78]Trench and Darling made sure of that.[5.33-7.06]I’m P6.[7.79-8.25]P.[8.70-9.95]Six.[11.02-12.49]But I’m better now.[13.19-14.67]The Hiss made me better.
M07_03_DYLAN_650: [1.11-3.97]Push the fingers through the surface into the wet.[4.32-6.15]You've always been the new.[6.43-7.85]You want this to be true.
M07_03_DYLAN_653: [0.04-2.28]It feels good to say those words.[3.28-5.05]I want to say them.[6.03-8.11]They sound good.[8.55-10.41]They make me feel good.[11.87-13.47]Don’t you want to say them too?
M07_03_DYLAN_655: You?
M07_03_DYLAN_656: You!
M07_03_DYLAN_657: [0.72-2.79]You came in through the hole in you.[2.82-3.65]We let you in.[3.65-5.85]You've always been here, the only child.[5.95-9.13]A copy of a copy of a copy of a copy.[9.13-9.97]Orange peel.
M07_03_DYLAN_660: [0.51-6.85]We found Polaris together with my sister, when we were very small,[7.00-14.14]in Ordinary, in the desert through the door opened up by the Slide Projector.[16.69-19.72]But she didn’t help when Trench took me away.[20.92-22.92]She didn’t give me any powers.[23.87-26.87]All the powers are my own powers.[29.59-32.94]She didn’t help when they locked me up for years.
M07_03_DYLAN_661: [1.15-3.18]After the song, time for applause.[3.69-5.64]We build you until nothing remains.[5.78-8.34]The egg cracks and the truth will emerge out of you.[8.63-10.69]You are home.
M07_03_DYLAN_663: [0.60-4.61]The Bureau brought the Slide Projector back here with me, [4.63-7.99]and the Bureau did what the Bureau does.[8.80-10.40]They used it.
M07_03_DYLAN_664: And they found-
M07_03_DYLAN_665: [0.03-1.88]They opened the door up to the Hiss.[2.98-5.61]That’s the only thing I can thank them for.
M07_03_DYLAN_666: [0.00-4.11]An earworm is a tune you can't stop humming in a dream.[4.16-7.98]Baby, baby, baby, yeah.[8.78-9.88]Just plastic.[10.09-13.50]So, safe and nothing to worry about.[13.50-17.78]Ha ha, funny.
M07_03_DYLAN_668: [0.03-1.55]I welcomed the Hiss.[2.47-3.71]I let it in.[4.73-6.21]To get rid of her.[6.90-8.83]The Hiss set me free.[10.67-12.24]Polaris is using you.[13.13-14.89]The Bureau is using you.[15.94-17.47]You are a puppet.
M07_03_DYLAN_669: [0.04-3.03]You can almost hear our words, but you forget.[3.66-5.56]This happens more and more now.[5.81-9.29]You gave us the permission in your regulations.
M07_03_DYLAN_671: [0.00-3.74]You must see the truth for yourself, Jesse, sister.[4.69-7.09]The horrible truth about the Bureau.[7.66-9.40]The Hiss is the better option.[10.13-13.36]Go to the Prime Candidate Program in the Containment Sector.[13.83-15.88]I have the keycard to get you there.[16.33-18.14]Salvador wanted me to have it.
M07_03_JESSE_3215: This is bad.
M07_03_JESSE_640: [0.30-1.27]Shit.[2.81-3.87]That's Dylan.
M07_03_JESSE_641: Can you hear me?
M07_03_JESSE_642: [0.36-1.64]Come on, Dylan.[2.23-3.04]I’m here.[3.98-4.86]I found you.
M07_03_JESSE_644: Do you know who I am?
M07_03_JESSE_645: [0.23-1.47]You know me.[2.44-3.24]Say it.
M07_03_JESSE_647: [0.31-2.46]He’s talking in the third person.[3.89-4.97]Always a good sign.
M07_03_JESSE_648: Do you know who you are?
M07_03_JESSE_651: [0.10-1.11]Can you stop that?[1.87-2.32]Please.
M07_03_JESSE_652: Not exactly the reunion I’d hoped for.
M07_03_JESSE_654: [0.93-1.46]No.[2.24-3.63]Fuck off, no.[4.56-6.60]You need to help me get this thing out of his head.[7.08-111.24]If he is still in there, if there’s anything left, you have to help me.
M07_03_JESSE_658: Stop it!
M07_03_JESSE_659: [0.22-0.78]Shit.[1.30-1.99]Shit![2.39-3.26]He can see you.[3.98-5.18]This is not safe.
M07_03_JESSE_667: [0.46-0.87]There.[1.57-2.27]There it is.[2.27-6.83]We stopped the Altered World Event in Ordinary when we shut down the Slide Projector.[8.87-10.46]And now the projector’s here.
M07_03_JESSE_670: [0.15-4.97]If we shut off the Slide Projector, maybe, maybe that will stop the Hiss.[6.41-8.56]Maybe it’s not too late for my brother.
M07_03_JESSE_672: [0.08-0.80]"Wanted?"[2.08-2.78]Bullshit.[2.98-4.74]I saw what the Hiss did to Salvador.[5.41-6.47]What it turned him into.
M07_03_JESSE_673: [0.10-0.82]Okay, Dylan.[1.99-2.51]I’ll go.[3.92-5.46]I want to see the truth for myself.
M07_03_JESSE_674: [0.45-4.53]I’ll go, but only to look for the Slide Projector.[6.19-7.07]You can help me.[8.69-9.84]We can end this.
M07_03_JESSE_676: [0.65-1.13]Okay.[1.64-3.98]The plan: We go to Containment.[4.21-5.96]Find the Prime Candidate Program.[6.42-10.72]If it's tied to Dylan, it's tied to Ordinary and the Slide Projector.[11.41-15.64]We'll track the Projector down, shut it off, and stop the Hiss.
M07_06_JESSE_1811: [0.23-0.75]I’m fine.[2.07-3.04]What can you tell me?[3.37-4.30]Is he still...[7.04-7.45]human?
M07_06_JESSE_1812: Or is he Hiss?
M07_06_JESSE_1814: What does that mean?
M07_06_JESSE_1816: [0.24-2.18]Dylan told me he let the Hiss in.[4.01-5.02]Does that change anything?
M07_06_JESSE_1818: [0.24-1.07]You won’t have it.[1.18-3.49]I’m gonna shut down the Slide Projector.[3.49-4.86]That’s how the Hiss are getting in.[5.98-9.31]Once I close it, this should all be over.
M07_06_JESSE_1820: Better that than what Dylan is now.
M07_06_JESSE_1821: [0.11-1.04]I’m shutting it down.[1.95-2.97]This has to end.[4.37-7.02]Whatever happens, happens.
M07_06_JESSE_1823: Thank you, Emily.
M07_06_POPE_1810: [0.08-1.56]How are you doing, Jesse?[2.24-4.49]It can’t be easy, seeing Dylan like this.
M07_06_POPE_1813: [0.19-3.72]I’ve taken numerous tissue samples and have tests running as we speak.[3.75-6.35]But from the initial data, he looks healthy.[6.66-8.96]I only see corruption in a superficial way.
M07_06_POPE_1815: [0.67-1.63]I don’t know.[1.72-2.74]This is all new.[3.33-6.54]If he’s like you, maybe Polaris is preventing total Hiss takeover.[6.86-9.68]Or maybe this is just a new form of Hiss.[10.05-12.73]We’ve already seen how it affects people in different ways.
M07_06_POPE_1817: [1.45-3.12]Voluntary conversion?[3.15-7.63]I mean, hypothetically, that could affect the mental state post-corruption,[7.64-10.23]as well as the extent of biological alteration.[11.19-13.04]Again, this is new territory for me.[13.36-14.41]I’ll need time.
M07_06_POPE_1819: [0.24-2.99]Jesse, we don’t know how this works.[3.44-7.94]If you sever their connection to the source, it could cause a terminal chain reaction.[8.43-11.56]Every Hiss-corrupted individual, dead.
M07_06_POPE_1822: [1.28-1.74]Okay.[2.03-3.77]Just let me know how I can help.
M07_10_JESSE_1786: [0.34-3.40]I wish things had gone differently in Ordinary for us.[5.12-7.86]But wishing won’t change things.[9.21-11.05]Finding the Projector will.
M07_11_JESSE_1787: [0.08-2.77]All the times I felt paranoid...[4.65-5.79]I was right.[7.02-9.75]They were spying, every detail.[9.75-16.32]My life has been a parade of nightmares, haunted by a million questions.[17.90-20.15]The Bureau could’ve given me the answers.[21.23-24.87]But they just stood by and watched me.
M07_11_JESSE_1788: [0.03-2.35]Is this what Dylan wanted me to see?[3.12-4.08]It doesn’t matter.[4.34-5.82]We need to find that Projector.
M07_11_JESSE_3216: [0.08-2.78]All the times I felt paranoid.[3.04-2.78].[3.04-2.78].[3.04-4.32]I was right.[4.47-6.73]The Bureau could’ve given me the answers.[6.80-9.81]But they just stood by and watched me.
M07_12_JESSE_1789: [0.00-2.17]They studied what happened in Ordinary here.[2.96-4.27]That’s the place to start looking.
M07_12_JESSE_1790: [0.00-3.21]Dylan and I were both Prime Candidates.[4.59-5.81]Experiments.
M07_12_JESSE_1791: [0.00-1.97]Very different ones, sure.[1.97-5.23]But both in a cell of some sort.[6.23-7.96]Am I out of the cell now?[7.96-16.76]Or is all this, the House and being the Director, just another cell?[17.79-19.75]Who’s really in charge here?
M07_14_JESSE_1792: [0.37-1.42]We’re going back home.[3.64-4.88]Of course we are.[6.18-12.15]It started there and it’s never gone away.
M07_17_JESSE_1793: Let’s see what they have on Ordinary.
M07_17_JESSE_1794: [0.04-7.16]They say when you visit your childhood home, everything feels small, like a miniature.[7.60-8.34]Not real.[8.91-10.08]They got that right.
M07_17_JESSE_1795: [0.05-4.74]It’s all here: our home, our school, the woods.[5.07-4.74].[5.07-4.74].[5.07-5.85]The dump.
M07_17_JESSE_1796: [0.03-3.08]We found the Slide Projector in the dump outside town.[3.55-5.64]Did they recreate that too?[6.21-7.65]Is that where they keep it?
M07_18_JESSE_1797: [0.03-5.27]They moved the whole landfill here, in the middle of New York.[5.46-7.45]And nobody saw a thing.[8.47-10.12]Pretty unbelievable.

M08_09_JESSE_1098: [0.24-1.80]There’s something up ahead.[2.97-3.71]Do you see it?
M08_10_JESSE_1113: [0.21-1.88]Did that really just happen?[1.88-3.81]Of course it did.[3.81-5.15]He gave me his cassette player.[6.20-8.24]It'll get me through the maze, huh?[9.22-11.00]The janitor always has the keys.

M09_02_JESSE_1403: Let’s go.
M09_02_JESSE_1404: Ha!
M09_02_JESSE_1405: That was awesome.
M09_03_JESSE_1406: [0.03-1.18]The slide projector.[2.26-4.64]Clearly, it’s a big deal to them as well.
M09_04_JESSE_1411: [0.00-1.26]Yeah, you want me here.[1.78-4.80]Finding the projector was how this all began.[5.29-8.23]What started in Ordinary ends here.[8.67-10.75]You, me, Dylan.[11.43-13.05]We’ve all come full circle.
M09_06_JESSE_1415: [0.17-1.49]There was a doorway here.[2.07-6.25]To where Dylan and I went, where the Projector took us, where we met you.[7.84-13.77]The Bureau opened the same door here, but there’s just an echo now.[16.22-16.96]Are you close?[18.50-19.63]Just on the other side?
M09_08_JESSE_1429: [0.20-3.47]Darling knew the Hiss was coming because you warned him.[4.92-6.84]He knew you could help fight it.
M09_09_JESSE_1420: [0.17-0.80]Hang on.[0.86-1.42]I’m coming.
M09_09_JESSE_1430: [0.11-0.92]I know you.[2.34-3.08]I remember.[3.08-3.98]From Ordinary.[5.91-8.14]I thought I’d never see you again.
M09_10_JESSE_1433: [0.38-1.51]Through here?[2.92-5.37]You are coming through so strong.[6.99-9.55]Darling used this HRA to lock the door.[9.55-11.34]I have to rip it off to get in.[13.09-14.06]Are you sure?

M09_STEP_00: Reach Dimensional Research
M09_STEP_00_LOG: Armed with Ahti’s cassette player, Jesse returns to the Maze, intent on reaching Dimensional Research and the Slide Projector to put an end to the Hiss threat.
M09_STEP_01: Navigate the Ashtray Maze to reach Dimensional Research
M09_STEP_02: Search the area for the Slide Projector Object of Power
M09_STEP_02_LOG: Jesse passes through the Ashtray Maze and reaches Dimensional Research. 
M09_STEP_03: Investigate the Hedron Chamber
M09_STEP_03_LOG: She discovers that the Bureau used the Slide Projector to enter another dimension, where they captured something they call “Hedron”. The Projector has been taken elsewhere, but Jesse realizes that Hedron is actually Polaris, her internal guide, and that Polaris herself is the source powering the HRAs.
M09_STEP_04: Cleanse the Siphons
M09_STEP_05: Reach Polaris
M09_STEP_05_LOG_COMPLETE: Jesse enters the Hedron Containment Chamber to go to Polaris. In order to do so, Jesse is forced to remove the HRA from the chamber door. This allows the Hiss to enter. They flood in and kill Hedron. Without Polaris to protect her, Jesse’s mind is vulnerable to the Hiss. She is corrupted. 
M10_01_AHTI_1116: [0.16-2.42]Are you sure you are not lost?[2.89-6.46]Maybe you can find yourself in the Director's office.

M10_01_JESSE_1534: [0.00-0.61]Thank you![1.01-1.55]Thank you!
M10_01_JESSE_1535: No problem!
M10_01_JESSE_1536: Let me know if you need anything else!
M10_01_JESSE_1537: Oh no, don’t mention it!
M10_01_JESSE_1538: Anything for the Bureau!
M10_01_JESSE_1539: Glad to be of assistance!
M10_01_JESSE_1540: Oh, no need, all part of the job.
M10_01_JESSE_1541: Thank you for giving me a chance.
M10_01_JESSE_1565: [0.07-0.63]Sorry.[0.76-1.40]I’m sorry.
M10_01_JESSE_1570: [0.51-0.84]Oh.[1.22-2.64]Of course, right away.[2.68-3.62]Thank you, Mr.[3.62-4.09]Director.
M10_01_LANGSTON_1542: [0.00-2.02]It’s wonderful work, it really is.[2.05-2.88]Important too.[3.04-4.25]Very proud to be a part of it.[4.39-5.24]Proud to serve.
M10_01_LANGSTON_1544: [0.28-3.38]Yes yes yes, Trench is great.[3.38-5.12]Never had a better Director.
M10_01_LANGSTON_1546: [0.34-2.26]I love big plans.[2.37-3.55]Can’t wait.[4.05-4.81]Back to work then?[5.03-6.93]These objects won’t catalogue themselves.
M10_01_LANGSTON_1548: [0.04-1.11]Counting the minutes.[1.14-3.33]We have great coffee here.
M10_01_LANGSTON_1556: [0.32-1.40]Did you see that?[2.02-4.03]The new girl took the Director's mail.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1497: You’re late!
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1498: You forgot something!
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1499: You can't find good help these days!
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1500: Why do they keep you around?
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1501: Time is money!
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1512: It’s on the desk.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1513: Pick it up.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1514: Get moving.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1515: Do your job.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1516: We haven’t got all day.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1527: That’ll be all.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1528: You’re dismissed.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1529: I’ve got nothing more for you.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1530: [0.00-0.63]Fine.[0.63-2.54]Now get out of here.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_1_1531: Don’t let it go into your head.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4038: You're late!
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4039: You forgot something!
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4040: You can't find good help these days!
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4041: Why do they keep you around?
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4042: Time is money!
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4043: It's on the desk.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4044: Pick it up. 
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4045: Get moving.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4046: Do your job. 
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4047: We haven't got all day. 
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4048: That'll be all.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4049: You're dismissed. 
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4050: I've got nothing more for you.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4051: [0.03-0.53]Fine.[0.83-1.69]Now get out of here.
M10_01_OFFICE_WORKER_2_4052: Don't let it go into your head. 
M10_01_POPE_1549: No, he’s not in... No, not today... a research project he has to oversee...
M10_01_POPE_1550: Yes, top secret stuff... strictly classified...
M10_01_POPE_1551: [0.19-2.97]He is, isn’t he...[3.24-5.99]Did you see him sing karaoke at the Christmas party?
M10_01_POPE_1552: Dreamy...
M10_01_POPE_1553: [0.19-1.71]Ugh, don't remind me.[2.24-5.65]We have this new office girl and I honestly don't know how she got the job.[5.96-7.69]No experience...[8.16-10.42]every little thing needs to be explained...[10.97-13.03]Internal recruiting, if you can believe it...[13.77-15.63]I heard she was in maintenance before...[16.11-17.37]Yes, really.[18.01-19.04]Yeah, it's a pain.
M10_01_POPE_1554: [0.28-1.24]Look, I got to go.[1.48-2.30]Call you later?[2.46-4.25]Okay, yes we will.[4.59-5.28]Bye.
M10_01_POPE_1558: [0.07-1.62]The nerve of this woman.[1.80-3.05]Who does she think she is?
M10_01_TRENCH_101: [0.10-2.09]Not now, I’m busy.[2.61-3.59]Come back later.
M10_01_TRENCH_104: [0.53-3.43]Oh great, I just was waiting for my mail.[4.15-6.66]Just leave it on the desk there, please.[7.21-8.91]So you’re the...[8.91-11.71]you're the new girl, right?[12.70-14.52]Well, welcome to the Bureau.[16.26-17.76]We’re glad to have you on board.[18.69-20.75]And you should be proud.[21.60-23.41]We do very important work here.
M10_01_TRENCH_105: [0.24-3.12]Oh, and don’t worry about starting at the bottom.[3.58-5.75]I wasn’t always the Director, you know.[6.44-10.89]My Bureau career began as a lowly agent.[11.43-13.55]Those were the days.[14.77-19.64]I never dreamed I’d one day be sitting here, an old man in this big chair.[20.90-26.91]Like they say, when you’re pushed upwards, you’ll end up out of your comfort zone.
M10_01_TRENCH_106: [0.24-2.73]Please take the outgoing mail as well.[3.25-3.70]Thank you.
M10_01_TRENCH_107: [0.21-0.83]Very good.[1.17-2.52]You’d better run along now.[2.80-4.27]I have a lot of work to do.[4.37-5.99]Important Bureau business.
M10_01_UNDERHILL_1555: [0.51-1.63]Did you hear already?[2.14-3.52]We have a crisis on our hands...[4.16-6.07]Yes, rather serious actually.[6.38-9.93]Helen, Ms. Marshall, called in sick today...[10.40-11.66]She was taken to the hospital.[12.12-13.49]We don't know if she's coming back.[13.79-15.80]Ms. Marshall really is quite old...[16.32-19.72]but only the Director's secretary ever brings him his mail.[20.14-21.68]Who's going to do it today?[22.22-26.72]He’s been waiting for his mail all day, but no one's stepping up.[26.84-31.53]Honestly, I’d hate to be here when the Director realizes his mail isn’t coming.
M10_01_UNDERHILL_1559: [0.39-2.05]Someone has to take it to him.[2.77-3.87]Better her than me.
M10_02_AHTI_1117: [0.09-1.54]You should keep trying.[2.26-3.45]You are getting closer.
M10_02_ARISH_1583: [0.03-3.90]Oh yeah, I have seen a lot of questionable shit in my time.[4.38-7.20]There’s enough incriminating evidence here to bury him in his mail alone!
M10_02_ARISH_1586: [0.17-1.79]That’s evidence against the Director.[2.18-3.17]Is she helping him hide it?
M10_02_JESSE_1573: [0.23-1.97]I’ve forgotten something.[1.97-2.98]I can’t think.[2.98-4.63]I’m lost.
M10_02_JESSE_1574: [1.30-2.54]Where are you?[2.54-5.24]I can’t feel anything.[5.24-5.27]I..[5.30-8.46]I don’t want to be alone here.
M10_02_JESSE_1575: [0.31-1.32]Where am I?[1.32-2.26]What is this?[3.05-4.30]Why won’t it end?
M10_02_JESSE_1576: [0.11-1.03]Wake up.[1.03-1.73]Please![2.70-4.10]I want to go home.
M10_02_JESSE_1590: I need to find my way back.
M10_02_JESSE_1594: [0.35-2.08]I need to go inside.[2.42-4.29]I need to keep moving.
M10_02_LANGSTON_1582: [0.21-3.04]It’s all coming to light now and it’s gonna be ugly.[3.36-6.06]Years of misconduct on the Director’s part.[6.20-7.24]Disgusting.[7.72-10.38]Tarnishes everything the Bureau stands for.
M10_02_LANGSTON_1584: [0.13-3.60]This is what happens when somebody with power isn't held accountable.[3.63-6.54]There was no supervision, no checks and balances.[6.77-7.66]But it ends here.[7.87-8.68]It's a new day.[8.90-11.35]The new Director will clean this place up.
M10_02_LANGSTON_1585: She took the Director’s mail. 
M10_02_POPE_1579: [0.55-1.98]Have you seen him?[1.98-2.10]Mr.[2.33-3.92]Faden, the new Director?
M10_02_POPE_1580: [0.40-3.61]Oh yeah, very handsome.[4.03-7.83]With Helen gone as well, he’ll be needing a new secretary, don’t you think?
M10_02_POPE_1581: [0.03-3.08]They say he is very smart as well.[3.64-7.73]It'll be great to have someone in charge who can really put the Bureau back on the map.
M10_02_POPE_1588: [0.40-3.21]Doesn’t she know how dangerous the old Director is?[3.71-4.95]He's unstable.[5.22-6.80]He’ll tear her apart.
M10_02_TRENCH_109: [0.09-0.65]Who is it?[1.31-2.48]What do you want?[4.00-5.04]Go away![6.03-7.23]Don’t bother me!
M10_02_TRENCH_110: [0.41-1.74]We’ve been invaded.[2.80-3.85]I must act.[5.28-7.80]I have a plan, an answer.[8.80-11.95]I’ll take the Slide Projector to the Nostalgia Department.[12.61-14.15]I’ll turn it on.[14.71-16.34]I’ll bring the Hiss in.[18.23-19.44]I’ll fix this.
M10_02_TRENCH_111: [0.46-3.38]I can hear them, plotting against me.[4.72-6.35]We’ve been invaded.[6.82-7.62]Corrupted.[8.55-9.95]I’ve lost Darling.[10.92-12.30]He was the first to go.[12.95-14.95]He’s been exposed to Hedron’s resonance.[15.56-17.31]It controls him now.[17.85-20.36]It controls everyone who wears the amplifier device.[20.97-24.63]I ordered them not to use the damn things![26.44-27.93]They didn’t listen.
M10_02_TRENCH_112: Hedron corrupted the Bureau. They’ll never be people again. They’re either dead, or they’re monsters. I’ll stop them. 
M10_02_TRENCH_113: I lost my train of thought, I... 
M10_02_TRENCH_114: It started as a distant whisper, like something you hear in a dream, a faraway voice calling you to wake up.
M10_02_TRENCH_115: You see, I was being taught a song, a poem...
M10_02_TRENCH_116: I often feel like I’m being watched, like there’s someone watching me. They can see me, but I can’t see them. 
M10_02_TRENCH_6235: [0.03-1.51]I have a secret ally.[2.23-3.82]The Nostalgia Department.[4.71-7.04]I have my own slide for the projector.[8.05-14.54]I took it - a memento - in Ordinary, after the girl burned them.[15.51-17.46]It’s burnt, but it’ll work.[18.54-20.94]The Hiss will save us all.
M10_02_TRENCH_6236: [0.05-8.70]It’s confused, like somebody switching channels too fast.[10.13-14.79]I see so much, but it's too fast.[15.93-22.15]On the expedition through the slide, something got into my ear...
M10_02_TRENCH_6237: …and it hurt at first, but then it didn’t.
M10_02_TRENCH_6238: [0.06-3.99]I’d open my eyes with those words still on my lips.[4.96-11.17]In the dream they had made perfect sense, but awake they’re like a…
M10_02_TRENCH_6239: [0.12-4.24]…like a foreign language, already forgotten.[6.99-18.83]Then the sense of loss hits, like losing a child, like losing yourself.
M10_02_TRENCH_6240: ...a prayer, that would light up my world and make me break through, make all this pain worth it. 
M10_02_TRENCH_6241: Something once lost was found and it made a home in me, a spring, with waves carving me…
M10_02_TRENCH_6242: [0.40-1.84]...making me see.[2.56-19.63]And it grew until it filled me, and I receded deeper into myself, into this office, locked in, in this Oldest House which is my aging body.
M10_02_TRENCH_6243: I stared in awe through the peephole, and I was filled with knowledge and made better.
M10_02_TRENCH_6244: [1.00-4.12]I remember it was like this dream I had last night.[4.21-8.79]There was this man here, in this very room.[10.11-12.35]Sometimes he was a plumber…
M10_02_TRENCH_6245: [0.55-24.87]...unclogging the drain - because there was a fish stuck there, a big fish - but sometimes he was an old god, you see, and he had put the fish there in the first place to keep the waste, there was rising waste, from leaking out.[25.34-29.50]So he was conflicted.[29.50-32.42]But he knew many things.
M10_02_TRENCH_6246: ...but he was also senile like me. It was like a riddle or an omen. Wasn't a very good one or an interesting one, but…
M10_02_TRENCH_6247: I get so confused so easily. It’s so very hard to follow everything that’s happening...
M10_02_UNDERHILL_1577: [0.86-1.58]It's shocking.[2.08-5.08]We all knew, I suppose, but no one wanted to say it out loud.[5.62-7.11]But now it's out in the open.[7.25-11.11]As painful as it is, it's a relief to admit it, like a weight has been lifted.[11.11-12.30]It’s gone on too long.[12.61-15.03]The Director is crazy, insane.
M10_02_UNDERHILL_1578: [0.51-2.74]Trench has grown more and more out of hand.[3.12-4.11]He’s dangerous.[4.55-7.10]Finally the Bureau is doing something about it.[7.63-10.23]They even brought Trench’s replacement in for a visit.
M10_02_UNDERHILL_1587: [0.24-2.22]She’s going to the old Director's office.[3.44-4.79]They must be working together.[4.79-6.05]She must be in on it.
M10_03_AHTI_1118: [2.12-3.25]Welcome back.[3.72-7.12]I knew I chose a good assistant.
M10_03_ARISH_1616: [0.30-1.87]You know, one morning, our keycards just aren’t gonna work.[1.87-3.09]We’re gonna be locked out and that's gonna be it.[4.20-5.13]Am I being paranoid?
M10_03_ARISH_1618: [0.43-1.22]All these layoffs.[1.22-1.78]The re-org.[2.34-5.11]I hear the Nostalgia Department’s already gone.
M10_03_JESSE_1606: [0.51-1.99]This is all inside my head.[3.20-4.54]The Hiss, burrowing in.[4.54-5.70]I’m trapped in here.[7.44-8.50]They’re taking over.
M10_03_JESSE_1607: What am I doing?
M10_03_JESSE_1608: None of this is real!
M10_03_JESSE_1609: I’m not doing this anymore!
M10_03_JESSE_1610: I need to get to Trench’s office.
M10_03_JESSE_1611: Fuck this shit!
M10_03_JESSE_1612: I’m done with this!
M10_03_JESSE_1613: [0.00-1.15]This is nonsense.[1.15-2.14]It stops now.
M10_03_JESSE_1614: I am not your servant.
M10_03_JESSE_1622: [0.18-1.29]I will fight this.[2.33-4.20]I will find a way to push them out.
M10_03_JESSE_1630: [0.48-1.37]Thanks, Ahti.[2.14-3.32]It's good to be back.[4.03-4.91]How come you’re here?
M10_03_JESSE_1631: [0.43-1.05]Nevermind.[1.59-5.23]Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some cleaning of my own to do.
M10_03_JESSE_1633: I need my gun.
M10_03_LANGSTON_1615: Have you heard the rumors? It’s just awful...
M10_03_LANGSTON_1617: [0.26-1.89]It’s not paranoia if it’s true.[2.12-4.07]There’s a hostile takeover in the works.[4.39-5.85]I mean, is it happening now?[5.99-7.05]Is it already over?
M10_03_LANGSTON_1619: Scary shit.
M10_03_POPE_1620: [0.27-2.33]I'm afraid something awful happened to Casper.[2.46-8.47]He was looking for a way to stop this, to save the whole Bureau, but the forces he was dealing with were too much.
M10_03_TRENCH_117: You are a worm through time. 
M10_03_TRENCH_6248: [0.51-3.07]The thunder song distorts you.[3.79-5.27]Happiness comes.
M10_03_TRENCH_6249: White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye. 
M10_03_TRENCH_6250: [0.31-4.04]Through a mirror, inverted is made right.[4.58-6.63]Leave your insides by the door.[7.13-9.70]Push the fingers through the surface into the wet.
M10_03_TRENCH_6251: [0.27-3.02]You’ve always been the new you.[3.37-5.60]You want this to be true.[6.11-9.59]We stand around you while you dream.[10.05-13.72]You can almost hear our words but you forget.
M10_03_TRENCH_6252: [0.69-3.21]This happens more and more now.[3.70-6.78]You gave us the permission in your regulations.[7.52-10.75]We wait in the stains.[11.56-14.97]The word that describes this is redacted.[15.51-16.75]Repeat the word.[17.00-19.11]The name of the sound.
M10_03_TRENCH_6253: [0.31-2.47]It resonates in your house.[3.26-7.08]After the song, time for applause.
M10_03_TRENCH_6254: [0.83-4.56]We build you till nothing remains.[5.03-8.00]The egg cracks and the truth will emerge out of you.[8.79-10.06]You are home.[10.40-13.42]You remind us of home.[14.04-17.62]You’ve taken your boss with your boss with you.[18.15-20.25]All hair must be eaten.
M10_03_TRENCH_6255: [0.52-8.68]Under the conceptual reality behind this reality you must want these waves to drag you away.[9.55-12.79]After the song, time for applause.
M10_03_TRENCH_6256: This cliché is death out of time, breaking the first the second the third the fourth wall, the fifth wall, floor; no floor: you fall! 
M10_03_TRENCH_6257: [0.49-3.21]How do you say “insane”?[4.68-6.46]Hurts to be happy.
M10_03_TRENCH_6258: An earworm is a tune you can’t stop humming in a dream: “baby baby baby yeah”.
M10_03_TRENCH_6259: [0.36-1.32]Just plastic.[1.50-4.22]So, safe and nothing to worry about.[4.53-7.06]Ha ha, funny.[7.40-10.41]The last egg breaks now.
M10_03_TRENCH_6260: [0.65-3.31]The hole in your room is a hole in you.[3.84-7.21]You came and we let you in through the hole in you.[7.75-11.42]You have always been here, the only child.[11.79-14.99]A copy of a copy of a copy.
M10_03_TRENCH_6261: [0.51-2.05]Orange peel.[2.63-7.26]The picture is you holding the picture.[7.94-14.49]When you hear this you will know you’re in new you.
M10_03_TRENCH_6262: [0.64-2.06]You want to listen.[2.26-4.03]You want to dream.[4.33-6.57]You want to smile.[6.90-8.61]You want to hurt.[9.58-12.11]You don’t want to be.
M10_03_UNDERHILL_1621: [0.13-1.31]It’s already too late.[1.77-2.84]They’re too powerful.[3.29-3.99]We lost.[4.46-5.92]The Bureau we knew is gone.
M10_05_JESSE_1643: [0.06-0.85]You’re gone.[1.46-1.93]Dead.[1.93-4.09]I can’t feel you.[4.09-7.54]I can’t- This is what Dylan wanted all along.[8.30-10.18]The Hiss in Dylan.
M10_05_JESSE_1644: But there’s something. I can feel it, but I don’t...
M10_05_JESSE_1645: I don’t know what.
M10_05_JESSE_1646: [0.53-5.92]The motel is a Place of Power, of change, a place to pass through.[6.33-8.21]Connecting everything.[9.24-10.85]This is a dream.[10.85-12.28]Inside my head.[12.67-15.19]Why shouldn’t it take me anywhere I want to go?
M10_05_JESSE_1647: Really?

OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_NERVOUS_CALLER_7548: I know they’re lying-
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_NERVOUS_CALLER_7553: They told me it was an industrial accident. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST: 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_4107: You're listening to America Overnight, 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_4109: If who found out, brother?
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_4111: This certainly doesn’t sound very “ordinary”, caller.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_4114: Please watch the language, caller.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_4116: So, the population of an entire town disappears, 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_4118: The same thing happened in Brazil in ‘23.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_4119: A mass abduction, 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_4121: Now, I warned you about the language, caller. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_4122: Hang in there. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7523: Thank you for staying with us.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7524: Here’s our first caller.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7534: It may be 2 a.m., but we’re still a family show.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7541: Tell me, was the phrase “There is no salvation” written anywhere?
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7542: A village called Hoer Verde.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7543: More than 600 people just up and left.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7544: The government said they were fleeing guerrilla forces.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7545: But we know the truth.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7549: I’m afraid we’re going to have to cut you off.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7550: And good timing too.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7551: It’s time for a short break.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_7552: America Overnight will be right back.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_8466: celebrating 29 years shining a light in the shadows.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_8467: yet the town remains. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_09_RADIO_HOST_8468: as predicted by my regular guest, Dr. Quincy Reagan.

OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST: 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_4123: You're listening to America Overnight: 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_4124: We've received an interesting letter here at the program. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_4125: Dear America Overnight:
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_4126: I can feel myself becoming gigantic. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_4127: I've read that the universe is expanding. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_4128: People write about the universe expanding like it's happening slowly. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_4129: How long can this go on for? 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_4130: Does anyone else feel this? 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_4131: And that's signed, Kate from Michigan.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_4132: Well, how 'bout it, America? 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_4133: America Overnight will be right back.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7575: broadcasting the truth no matter the consequence
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7576: Thank you for staying up with us.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7577: If you'll humor me, I'd like to read it.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7578: It's constant.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7579: A growth in all directions, in each cell.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7580: Only, when I measure myself, it says I'm the same height.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7581: I weigh the same weight.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7582: If that's the case, then 5'3" is taller than what 5'3" was yesterday.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7583: I feel it all the time, this expanding.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7584: I always have.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7585: I don't know why.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7586: Sometimes it's all I can do just to ignore it.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7588: But it's not.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7589: We were the size of mice yesterday.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7590: Now mice are the size of us
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7591: There must be an end, right? 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7592: A limit?
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7593: An edge?
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7594: What happens when we reach it?
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7595: Can anything be done?
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7596: Have you felt the universe expanding?
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7597: Do you know how to stop it?
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_7598: Should we even try?
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_8469: for 29 years and counting.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_10_RADIO_HOST_8470: and we are the size that mice will be in two days.

OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_4134: You're listening to America Overnight, 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_4135: I’ve been getting a lot of calls about this meteor in Sterling, Colorado. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_4136: Now, we happen to broadcast from Colorado, and Sterling isn’t far.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_4137: I drove down myself to check it out
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_4138: I don’t need to tell you, 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_4139: Listeners, this is yet another instance of an unidentified flying object,
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_4140: And while you’re doing that, our sponsors would like your ear.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_4141: America Overnight will be right back.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_7599: now in our 29th year lifting the veil between fiction and reality.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_7600: Thank you for staying up with us.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_7601: There are reports of a large, spherical container 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_7602: Some government people reportedly took it away.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_7603: That the government took away the evidence under cover of darkness
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_7604: or dare I say, solar system.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_7605: Head on over to our website to see pictures of the spacecraft pieces we uncovered.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_7606: only compounds the fact that these are more than likely visitors from beyond our planet...
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_7607: or “UFO”, entering our airspace and crashing. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_8471: that crash-landed in a field outside town.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_8472: with members of the America Overnight team.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_11_RADIO_HOST_8473: it wasn’t long before we found pieces of metal debris scattered in a field.

OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_4145: Thanks. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_4146: Now, the manager explained that, years back,
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_4147: I happily took the room.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_4148: I fell asleep pretty quick, 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_4149: checking under the bed first of course.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_4150: But when I woke up, I found myself under the bed. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_4151: The Night Manager was kind enough to find me another room.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7828: This is something I experienced recently, 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7829: while staying at the Chilly Pines Motel in Macon 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7830: I was in room 47.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7831: The night manager, an avid listener of the program, 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7832: the body of a man was discovered under the bed, 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7833: The body had been there a week, he said.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7834: Guests had stayed there,
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7835: They only found the body 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7836: Hauntings have been reported in room 47 ever since.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7837: No chilly spots or flickering lights.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7838: It was dark and stiflingly hot.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_7839: Luckily, I was able to push the mattress off 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_8476: insisted I take this particular room. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_8477: inside that wooden border that motel beds tend to have. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_8478: sleeping with the corpse a foot below them. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_8479: when housekeepers complained about the smell. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_8480: for last year's SuspiciCon.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_8481: No ghosts visited me. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_QUINCY_REAGAN_8482: and crawl out before I suffocated.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST: 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_4142: You're listening to America Overnight,

OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_4154: America Overnight will be right back.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_7825: mystifying the airwaves for more than 29 years.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_7826: Thank you for staying up with us.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_7827: We've had many callers over the years tell us of hauntings, voices, 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_7840: What we call ghosts take many forms.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_7841: Quincy was brave enough to tell his story.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_7842: And I encourage you to keep calling and writing 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_7843: Something you can’t explain. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_7844: Maybe you’re seeing colors that we have no name for. 
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_7845: Maybe your toaster is possessed.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_8474: and other phantasmagorical phenomena.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_8475: Quincy.
OPCON_AUDIOLOG_12_RADIO_HOST_8483: whenever you encounter something strange.

OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_1287: There is a curious correlation with the yet unknowable forces
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_1288: So clearly, humanity affects this process. 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_1289: And yet, there is something unique in us, in our dreams, 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_1290: What’s the cause and what’s the effect? 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_1291: We’ll struggle to find answers to these hard questions...
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_1292: Or die trying.
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8344: These forces gravitate toward archetypal objects: 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8345: a gun, a television, a supposedly haunted house. 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8346: We create these archetypes through everyday life, popular culture, urban legends,
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8347: Our collective unconscious is a map of sorts.
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8348: We hold the key but we don’t know how to use it. 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8349: We can change the likelihood of something being a receptacle for these forces 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8350: but we haven’t found a method to control the outcome. 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8351: but we are observing and influencing a complicated system in action. 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8352: Are we the starting point, or just a necessary evil in this? 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8353: A by-product, A reflection? 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8354: A projection?
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8492: intruding upon our world in the form of Altered World Events. 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8493: just by thinking about it, 
OPCON_DARLING_01_DARLING_8494: in the conceptual reality we power with our minds. 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_1293: August 4, 1964. 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_1294: Once we became aware of it, it was there. 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_1295: It’s a Place of Power, an ongoing AWE of its own,
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_1296: Note: for more details on Control Points and the research 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_1297: After extensive research and investigation, 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_1298: The Federal Bureau of Control was never out in the open. 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_1299: So imagine our surprise when the building’s observation-resistant aspects began, 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8149: We discovered the Oldest House while investigating a suspected Altered World Event case
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8150: The agents found their way up into the building. 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8151: For the rest of the population, it was hiding in plain sight, 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8152: and yet constantly breaking the known boundaries of reality, 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8153: This was always an obfuscated, classified, top secret operation. 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8495: in the New York City Subway tunnels. 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8496: a slippery blind spot seemingly discouraging observation.
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8497: seemingly adhering to its physical outer constraints, 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8498: it's unstable and shifting. 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8499: and process to stabilize and secure the core sectors, refer to a separate presentation. 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8500: the Bureau made the building its headquarters on November 13, 1968. 
OPCON_DARLING_02_DARLING_8501: in some unquantifiable way, to affect the Bureau as a whole.
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_1300: The Astral Plane.
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_1301: Most information on the Astral Plane is classified, 
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_1302: The white non-space. 
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_1303: Yes.
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_8154: Similar to an iceberg, what you see is not what you always get. 
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_8155: Regardless, this place is vitally important to the Bureau. 
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_8156: keeping in mind that these are staggeringly complex systems,
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_8157: The ever-present, inverted black pyramid. 
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_8158: The Board. 
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_8159: All linked. 
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_8160: Intrinsically tied to the Oldest House, tied to the Director,
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_8161: tied to all Objects of Power, in terms of who controls them?  
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_8502: and simplification does them no justice. 
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_8503: but we can talk in broad strokes, 
OPCON_DARLING_03_DARLING_8504: the process of choosing a director, 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_1304: The exact process of how an Altered Item is born eludes us. 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_1305: We find them in the aftermath of Altered World Events. 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_1306: The superstitious would call them cursed. 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_1307: Are Altered Items sentient? 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_1308: While generally less potent than Objects of Power, 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_8164: They take the form of everyday objects, ever-present in our lives, 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_8165: Now infused with unpredictable energies, they are altered. 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_8166: Not quite. 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_8167: They are often fixated, programmed almost, 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_8168: Left unchecked, they can be highly dangerous. 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_8169: To study Altered Items, we contain them.
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_8170: In Panopticon.
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_8505: constantly evoked in the thoughts of millions of people.
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_8506: to cause certain events to happen over and over again. 
OPCON_DARLING_04_DARLING_8507: they are not able to be controlled. 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_1309: Welcome to the Research Sector of the Federal Bureau of Control. 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_1310: Somebody thought this video would make for great internal communication.
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_1311: So. This is where the magic happens.
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_1312: Anyway. 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_1313: I’ve always been here. 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_1314: Through those years, we’ve made astonishing discoveries. 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_1315: And do follow the safety protocols, read the manual, 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_8171: I’m Doctor Casper Darling, Head of Research. 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_8172: I’m looking at you, Mr. Tommasi.
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_8173: Authored studies of grave importance. 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_8174: In all of this work, there is one thing we know, and that’s how little we truly know. 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_8175: Rest assured we’re committed to keep pushing the known laws and borders of reality, 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_8176: So welcome, assuming you have the necessary clearance. 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_8177: I’ve been here for 24 years now.
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_8508: and to make the Bureau proud. 
OPCON_DARLING_05_DARLING_8509: otherwise bad things will happen.
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_1316: Ordinary. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_1317: And the boy, Dylan Faden. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_1318: We’re talking Northmoor-level readings here, 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_1319: It's remarkable. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_1320: There was an incident. Yes. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_1321: But he’s just a kid.
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_1322: He is exceptional and under a lot of stress. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8178: So much coming together in this one case. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8179: A new Object of Power. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8180: Something we’ve not seen before. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8181: Coming from me, that’s saying something. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8182: Prime Candidate 6. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8183: And the sister as well, once we catch up with her. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8184: But the boy. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8185: So much potential.
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8186: It's completely different circumstances here. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8187: We lost a valuable member of our team, yes.
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8188: Excessive force, but Dylan has so much. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8189: I'll take the blame. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8190: He needs some slack. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8191: Boys will be boys. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8192: Roberts got killed. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8193: It's an unfortunate accident, that’s all. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8194: Marshall needs to realize this. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8195: We will make this work. We'll make this work. 
OPCON_DARLING_06_DARLING_8510: and I don’t want to invoke his name. 
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING_1323: Objects of Power can cause, or be results of, AWE’s - Altered World Events - 
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING_1324: A side-note: 
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING_1325: Now, the Service Weapon is of course a prime example of an O.o.P.,
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING_1326: Lose, and you’re, well, fired. 
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING_1327: Thank you. 
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING_8196: come out of that Russian roulette a winner, and you, you're  it.
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING_8197: I’m Doctor Darling, Head of Research, Federal Bureau of Control.
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING_8198: remember to cover their connection to the Astral Plane as well. 
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING_8511: intrusions upon the perceived reality. 
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING_8512: a very powerful one,
OPCON_DARLING_07_DARLING_8513: ingrained in the Bureau's DNA, a key component in our Prime Candidate program: 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_1328: Ring! Ring! 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_1329: In 1978, a Comms Department intern heard the Hotline ring and picked it up, 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_1330: Only the Director can answer it safely and what he hears is kept classified.
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_8199: It’s Dr. Darling calling. 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_8200: She never recovered, 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_8201: It is a phone. 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_8202: It’s an Object of Power. 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_8203: It doesn’t connect to any typical network.
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_8204: A direct line to the Astral Plane and the Board, 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_8205: Our very own Ouija board.
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_8514: going against every safety protocol in the manual. 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_8515: and the handful of witnesses required extensive memory repression therapy. 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_8516: and my hypothesis is, under the right conditions, 
OPCON_DARLING_08_DARLING_8517: to other planes of existence as well. 
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_1331: Just look at it: 
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_1332: This is not THE disk, of course, but one exactly like it. 
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_1333: It is a receptacle - for dangerous energies to hone in on. 
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_1334: And it can launch things telekinetically through the air.
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_1335: To date, we’ve launched, maybe, three dozen pencils.
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_1336: And once we even launched a cup.
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_8206: 8 inches wide and capable of storing a whopping 80 kilobytes. 
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_8208: A perfect fusion of concepts vibrating in the Cold War era collective unconscious, 
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_8209: Hah!
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_8210: Stolen by our friends at the CIA, 
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_8211: And they did. 
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_8212: We don’t have the details, but when things started flying around the disk, 
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_8213: It’s an Object of Power,  O.o.P., oops!
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_8518: the disk held the launch codes to Soviet nukes.
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_8519: a receptacle...
OPCON_DARLING_09_DARLING_8520: it was transferred to us. 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_1337: During an AWE investigation, 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_1338: Dream-like haze. 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_1339: Inside, they found a door marked with an inverted black pyramid.
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_1340: And just like that, it led back to the Oldest House, 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_1341: The actual physical location of the Oceanview is a mystery. 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_1342: A Place of Power. 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_8214: They pulled the cord 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_8215: Now we’re finding the cord in increasing numbers throughout the Bureau. 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_8216: Stepping beyond its walls has so far proven impossible. 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_8217: Like the Oldest House.
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_8218: Somehow, the two places, they became attuned to each other.
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_8521: our agents discovered a light switch cord 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_8522: in a Butte bungalow closet. 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_8523: and were instantly transported to the Oceanview Motel and Casino. 
OPCON_DARLING_12_DARLING_8524: some 2,000 miles from Montana. 
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_1343: Dylan’s a lost cause. 
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_1344: I thought his youth was an asset... just too much too soon.
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_1345: Effective immediately, I’m setting up a new department, 
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_8219: I know I struggled to see this. 
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_8220: We've contained him now.
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_8221: I wish I’d sided with Marshall back when it was just one person...
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_8222: So many dead. 
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_8224: That’s where my focus will be now. 
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_8225: The Ordinary site remains as is. 
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_8226: We’ll be back... 
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_8227: I don’t know when.
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_8525: Dimensional Research, in the Research Sector, 
OPCON_DARLING_13_DARLING_8526: transferring the Slide Projector there. 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_1346: The projected image from each slide is a physical portal into another dimension. 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_1347: The topography of Slidescape-36 bears deep wave marks. 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_1348: There were casualties on our first expedition. 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8228: Only one slide remains. 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8229: Dylan’s sister burned the rest in Ordinary before we could intercept. 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8230: The text on it: 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8231: On the slide and in the distance, there’s a formation of five pillars, 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8232: Communication is an issue. 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8233: There is no sound there, as if you’ve gone deaf, 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8234: Correction, a resonance from an unknown source, 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8235: It acts in unpredictable ways, causing feedback loops that can tear you apart. 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8236: Trench insists he heard something else.
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8237: It made his ears bleed. 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8238: Our equipment found no evidence of anything beyond the primary resonance.
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8239: Trench’s medical tests show nothing amiss.
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8528: “COLOR SLIDE FILM, THIS SIDE TOWARDS SCREEN” and the number “36”. 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8529: like crude outstretched fingers. 
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8530: and radios don't work.
OPCON_DARLING_14_DARLING_8531: in part within the range of audible frequency.
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_1349: Expedition 3.
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_1350: We’ve built a container for it, we've brought it in. 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8240: We located the source of the resonance in Slidescape-36. 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8241: It is an entity, a living organism of a considerable mass.
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8242: I’ve named it “Hedron” based on its physical shape...
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8243: the part that we can perceive. 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8244: I honestly think there’s... 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8245: The resonance it emits... 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8246: The frequencies... 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8247: We’ve never seen anything like it. 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8248: This changes everything. 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8249: It’s beyond our understanding. 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8250: We have brought so many questions with us 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8251: I will dedicate... 
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8252: I’m never going home.
OPCON_DARLING_15_DARLING_8532: through that hole in the wall. 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_1390: An early hypothesis was that the mindscape of the Astral Plane is subjective. 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_1391: But then, one could argue that’s the case with all reality.
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_1392: We’ve been able to record footage of the Astral Plane 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_1393: ...apart from one shocking exception.
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_6513: In the Astral Plane footage, we're always in the vicinity of the pyramid. 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_6514: We have glimpsed movement, native species, always in the distance. 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_6515: We don't have footage of this, a technical malfunction, 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_6516: It's a relentless predator, pursuing thoughts, minds, 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8253: But that was fast proven wrong.
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8254: It’s an actual place, not a construct of the mind, 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8255: That is the only concrete material 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8256: We've concluded that this, not the entire plane, is what the Board controls. 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8257: And yet, contact was made.
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8258: A Brain Cloud, an Astral Fugue, had hitchhiked a ride in his head.
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8259: Proper containment protocols are to be observed when dealing with it. 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8533: even though it is with our minds that we enter and experience it.
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8534: by monitoring the brain activity of those experiencing it. 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8535: It ruptured out, killing the subject in question.
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8536: but when one of our Astralnauts returned... 
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8537: that has come out of the Astral Plane expeditions...
OPCON_DARLING_17_DARLING_8538: lethal to those the entity feeds on. 
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_1351: Resonance is the key. 
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_1352: Physics. 
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_1353: These fields in complex interaction... 
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_1354: Hedron is communicating with me. 
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_1355: We are about to be exposed to a different kind of resonance, 
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_1356: That’s what the Hedron Resonance Amplifiers are for:
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_8260: Altering reality that comes to contact with them.
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_8261: Trying to warn me of something imminent.
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_8262: I’ve been using every known method to analyze the data. 
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_8263: Exposing myself to it, I’m seeing things and overcome by compulsions. 
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_8264: And it’s not just data, it’s protection, it’s benign.
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_8265: taking the protection Hedron can provide us, 
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_8539: Vibration, frequencies, waveforms, fields we didn’t know were there.
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_8540: a hostile, viral, invasive resonance. 
OPCON_DARLING_18_DARLING_8541: and keeping us from being wiped out.
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1357: I’ve been fielding questions recently regarding HRAs: 
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1358: And what’s the deal with the Hedron Resonance, anyway?
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1359: I’ll-
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1360: Fuck.
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1361: Despite what you may have heard, HRAs are not monitoring devices.
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1362: We are not tracking your movements or listening to your conversations 
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1363: We do that regardless of whether or not you’re wearing an HRA.
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1364: Think of them as a life preserver.
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1367: Only instead of water, the thing HRAs protect you from is classified. 
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1368: One day, that classified not-water might pour in, 
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1369: And if you don’t have an HRA, don’t worry. It’ll be quick and painless.
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_1370: Kidding. I'm kidding. 
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_8266: What are they for? 
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_8267: Do you always need to wear them?
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_8268: We’re making more.
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_8542: while you’re wearing them. 
OPCON_DARLING_19_DARLING_8543: and you’ll be glad you’ve got an HRA keeping you afloat.
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_1371: There areas in the Oldest House, where under the right conditions, 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_1373: Oh, Emily! 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_1374: Get it?
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8269: We call these areas Thresholds. 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8270: The Quarry is one of the more stable Thresholds
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8271: That’s where Black Rock comes from. 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8272: Extra-dimensional matter.
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8273: It has the unique property of blocking out a lot of frequencies,
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8274: Think of it as paranatural lead. 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8275: Our research involves many dangerous things 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8276: That’s what the Black Rock lined Firebreaks are about. 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8277: The Panopticon container cells...
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8278: The codes.
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8279: Black Rock. 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8280: 6-6-5. 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8281: Neighbor of the beast. 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8544: when the frequencies match, other dimensions leak in. 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8545: in the Maintenance Sector.
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8546: a good thing - it keeps things stable, contained. 
OPCON_DARLING_20_DARLING_8547: we absolutely need to keep in check. 
OPCON_DARLING_20_POPE: 
OPCON_DARLING_20_POPE_1372: Sorry to interrupt, sir, but I need the code for the Quarry elevator.
OPCON_DARLING_20_POPE_1375: Ha ha.
OPCON_DARLING_20_POPE_O.S.: 
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_1376: It’s done. 
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_1377: I’ll be there, inside.
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_1378: Ready to be blown away. 
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_1379: To be Bowman, flying into the monolith... 
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_1380: Ready to see...
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_1381: ...to understand.
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_8282: With just one large-scale HRA.
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_8283: It’s there now. 
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_8284: Protecting the most important thing from what’s coming. 
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_8285: Locked in.  
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_8286: Commencing countdown, Major Tom. 
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_8287: Ready for the journey-
OPCON_DARLING_23_DARLING_8548: It was an easy choice, no choice.
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING: 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_1383: I’m doctor Casper Darling and this is my final message.
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_1384: It’s not the end, but after this I won’t... 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_1385: I’ve seen-
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_1386: Slidescape-36 was where Hedron stopped the spread of another... 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_1387: I’ve done everything I can to stop it, 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_1388: I don’t know if it’ll make a difference. 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_1389: I won’t be here when it happens. 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8288: I’ve exposed myself to Hedron resonance, fully. 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8289: It has... 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8290: It’s changing me. 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8291: I've been shown so much. 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8292: it’s terrifying, it really is... 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8293: another source of resonance. 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8295: Trench was exposed to this other... 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8296: It will now spread...
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8297: I should have told Emily more. 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8298: I’m being sent one more lesson. 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8300: something wonderful, I think... 
OPCON_DARLING_25_DARLING_8549: the Hedron Resonance Amplifiers...

The crew <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> by throwing a tin bucket, which disappeared into the sphere.</p>

<p>Soon after, the vessel lost structural integrity. The ship’s metal rusted and fell apart within minutes. As the ship sank, the sphere lowered into the water. A passing fishing vessel called the <em>[REDACTED]</em> rescued the four surviving crew. </p>

<p>Agents were dispatched to the White Ocelot’s last known coordinates (<em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>) and began diving operations. On the ocean floor, the agents found the sphere. The ship was entirely destroyed except for its anchor. As agents lifted the anchor off the ocean floor, they noticed the sphere behaved in conjunction with the anchor, moving and stopping as one. </p>

<p>Contact with the sphere was avoided, but handling the anchor proved harmless. The item was transported by the <em>[REDACTED]</em> to the US port of <em>[REDACTED]</em>. Upon arriving in New York, it was brought into the Bureau via the <em>[REDACTED REDACTED RED]</em>. </p>

<p> (extract from formal interdepartmental complaint) </p>

<p>The notion of “fan death” has now become widely known in the region, since Foreign Investigator <em>[REDACTED]</em> met with a local journalist to explain how electric fans operate at speeds that may suffocate users by overly disturbing the air. </p>

<p>As our agency is still young, we must take care to avoid missteps. Any explanation given to the public must provide sufficient yet vague rationale that will reaffirm their certainty that ours is a stable, controlled world. We must tread carefully, especially in this increasingly technological world, with the radio and other innovations allowing information to travel at speeds previously undreamt of. This is precisely why we insist that our department handle all communication with public bodies. </p>

Bureau agents raided his penthouse and found numerous paranatural belongings, including <em>[REDACTED]</em> <em>REDACTED REDACTED]</em> and this item. Mr. Wolff was arrested. </p>

<p> “So why would a 36-year-old Bay Street investment trader, filthy rich, married to a model, disappear overnight? That’s the question that’s kept Toronto high society up at night this past week. Police say it’s being looked into, some nut job radio show in the States claims he disappeared to join the Illuminati, but it’s this reporter’s opinion that Mr. Wolff, bored of his job, sick of his family, left it all behind to retire in some remote beach paradise. Now he’s sipping Mai Tais while the world thinks he’s dead.” </p>

<p><u>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE: </u></p>

<p>Item must be kept in isolation, removed from other unsecured objects. Under no circumstances is the item to be sat in.</p>

<p><u>DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT: </u></p>

<p>A plastic seat shaped like a human hand from the 1960s. The hand’s palm forms a seat with the fingers acting as the chair’s back. </p>

<p>The item affects gravitational forces, attracting and repelling objects near itself with a force of <em>[RED]</em>. Its fingers have also been observed to change position, though too quickly to be witnessed or filmed. The item may be changing forms rather than moving. </p>

<p>The item only displays these effects during full moons. </p>

<p>Sample analysis confirms that it contains human genetic material. </p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>

<p>Found in a warehouse at <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>, Albany. A team of ranger trainees (accompanied by an experienced field agent) were dispatched to investigate local rumors when they encountered the item. They successfully retrieved the item (see case PAI-6122 for details). </p>

<p>Item is to be kept in a secure location in the Executive Sector (see security order 239-A). The room must be sealed before usage to prevent unintentional transportation of staff. </p>

<p><u>DESCRIPTION/PARAUTILITY: </u></p>

<p>A classic 1950s jukebox, made by Songmaster Entertainment LTD. The Jukebox was found with a single record inside, titled “A Song for the Others” by <em>[REDACTED]</em>. </p>

<p>When this record is played in the object, anyone within earshot is translocated for as long as the album is playing. Those involved in the object's first known incident report being transported to a tropical beach (exact location unknown). </p>

<p>When this object is used in the Oldest House, it only transports users to an area located in the recently-manifested Quarry Threshold. Researchers theorize that this site's unique spatial density results in all transitioning material gravitating to its position, as has been observed with other Bureau equipment. The Oldest House’s unique nature could also be having an effect on the object itself. </p>

<p>This object is not bound to any known individual. Attempts by Bureau staff to bind it have resulted in <em>[REDACTED]</em> and should not be attempted again. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>SUBJECT: BLESSED REPAIR AND SERVICE</b></p>

<p><u>CAUSE FOR INVESTIGATION: </u></p>

<p>The Songmaster Jukebox (OOP10-KE) came to the Bureau’s attention through a local radio piece regarding Tex’s Roadside Diner and the events that transpired there. Every diner reported being temporarily transported to an undetermined location that they later described as a sandy coastline. The Bureau took custody of the object the same day. The diners were told a gas leak was responsible for their imagined beach vacations. </p>

<p>In an interview with the diner’s owner, it was discovered that the albums in the object had been replaced the day before the event by a service responsible for the machine’s upkeep, who left only the single <em>REDACT</em> record inside. Agents attempted to track down “Blessed Repair and Service” but could find no company by that name in the state.</p>

<p><b>ACTION TAKEN:</b></p>

<p>“Blessed Repair and Service” has been added to the list of outstanding investigations. Any and all information on this business, its employees, or any known associates should be forwarded to Mr. <em>REDACTED</em> in the Investigations Sector immediately.</p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>

<p>The lantern was discovered at a streetside ramen shop in Tokyo, Japan named <em>[REDACTED]</em>. The shop gained immense popularity due to this item, this shining beacon hanging in its doorway. A visiting documentarian was similarly enthralled by the crimson luster of the lantern and helped it find international acclaim through a television series highlighting the world's finest restaurants. Audience's interest in the lantern brought it to the attention of the Bureau and soon the lantern found its way here, to us. I write this as I sit beside the very item. Its light is so comforting, so familiar. It reminds me of summer nights when I was a boy. The sun setting, the air warm, the chittering song of the evening insects. The lantern knows we all want to feel safe, at home, secure in the knowledge that the world won’t change and neither will we. We’ll be young and happy forever, here in its glow.</p>

<p>The author of this document was detained shortly after this case file was distributed. Individual handling of the item is now prohibited. Information in this document may be compromised by the author’s obvious infatuation with the item.</p>

<p><u>DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT: </u></p>

 <p>A dark blue United States post box, model <em>[REDA]</em>. Paint is chipped at the edges. The item itself is empty, with no mail discovered inside at the time of retrieval.</p>

<p>The item seizes the motor functions of organisms meeting an unknown criteria. Paralyzed subjects are still capable of moving their eyes and limited speech. During tests, approximately 16% of agents remained unaffected by the item. Age, gender, race, height, weight, blood type, eye color, clothing, place of birth, diet, heart rate, and socioeconomic standing are all factors proven to have no correlation to an individual’s vulnerability to the item. Victim’s states of mind were recorded during onset of paralysis, but no emotional correlation has yet been found.</p>

<p><u>BACKGROUND:</u></p>

 <p>Agents arrived in the town of Jasper Crossing, Arizona after the communications department intercepted multiple phone calls to local authorities regarding “frozen people” in the streets. Four of the five dispatched agents became paralyzed upon arriving at the scene. Additional assessment teams were dispatched.</p>

<p>Variations of Identification Formulas were tried with ineffectual results. Agents resorted to using aerial photography to study the positioning of the paralyzed individuals. Soon after, agents discovered the event’s “epicenter” to be the local post office.</p>

<p>Unaffected agents cleared the area of all paralyzed civilians, animals, and Bureau personnel before beginning to study the item. Agents deemed susceptible to the item were tasked with interviewing and re-informing the public away from the site.</p>

<p>The item was soon placed on a transport vehicle manned by unaffected agents. Air travel had been deemed too dangerous given the item's effect. Numerous reports of temporary paralysis were reported by civilians along the truck’s route from Arizona to New York City.</p>

<p>Locals report that she rarely left her home in the short years she spent in <em>[REDACTED]</em>. After her death (caused by <em>[REDACTED</em> <em>REDACTED]</em>) the state held a public auction of her belongings, seeing as she had no known relatives. </p>

<p>Various conflicting firsthand reports exist, but testimonies provided by witnesses of the event do contain some common elements. Most every witness saw numerous mannequins break through the house’s windows, tumbling outside. Some witnesses report bright lights. Some report high-pitched singing. These are unverified. Numerous civilians inside the house at the time of the incident were hospitalized for various injuries. Two were crushed to death. </p>

<p>Agents were dispatched upon seeing an article regarding these events during the Bureau’s daily scans of national periodicals. The item was quickly identified and brought to the Bureau. </p>

<p>A: Where were you on August 2, 1979, Mr. Beaulieu? </p>

<p>RB (translated from French): So specific a date! (laughter) As if I could ever forget. I was called to a fire at the Rue <em>[REDACTED]</em>. </p>

<p>A: What did you see? </p>

<p>RB: Smoke, white like a new Pope, rising up from the windows of a small shop. I sent my men in. I was fire chief back then. </p>

<p>A: What happened next? </p>

<p>RB: We pulled the shop owner out. He was already dead. Smoke in his lungs. We found the source afterwards. A baby's walker. Poured water onto it, but that only encouraged the smoke. We pulled the carriage outside. Smoke kept shooting out! A crowd gathered. People said it was a miracle. But I disagreed. It seemed to me like more of an omen. We brought the strange thing back to the fire hall. Some Americans, like yourself, came later and took it away. </p>

<p><u>CONTAINMENT PROCEDURE: </u></p>

 <p>No method for suppressing the item’s thaumaturgical effect is yet known. To prevent infection, wear proper safety gloves when handling.</p>

<p><u>DESCRIPTION/ALTERED EFFECT: </u></p>

<p>The item is a wooden mallet from a “High Striker” carnival game. A long wooden handle extends from the head.</p>

<p>The item infects any organic material with an unknown disease upon making physical contact. The effects of this disease are similar to leprosy, but develop at a much faster rate. Within a matter of days, tissue loss develops in the limbs closest to the point of infection. While the disease itself has not claimed any lives, secondary infection has resulted in numerous deaths. </p>

<p><u> BACKGROUND: </u></p>

<p>The Smiley Sisters Carnival traveled throughout the eastern United States during the 1950s. Beginning in 1956, young men in the towns visited by the carnival became plagued by a strange form of leprosy originating in the hands and swiftly moving up the arms. As the death toll climbed, newspapers named the disease “Farmer’s Rot”.</p>

Rumors began circulating that the carnival itself was to blame. In November of 1959, the townspeople of <em>[REDACTED]</em>, Georgia took it upon themselves to raze the carnival to the ground, believing the entertainers to be servants of the devil.</p>

<p>Bureau agents had been monitoring the carnival while investigating the odd disease. Posing as <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>, agents confiscated all carnival property that survived the flames. At a field office, stray <em>[REDACTED]</em> were placed in rooms with individual pieces of the carnival equipment. The game hammer was identified as the cause of the disease. The remaining property was incinerated, along with the infected <em>[REDACTED]</em>. The carnival owners were told they had been carrying a dangerous pathogen in their equipment.</p>

<p>The item was taken from the <em>[REDACTED]</em>, a Canadian research station established on Ross Island in Antarctica, where it was used to celebrate the holiday season. In 1979, solar radiation damaged the radio, severing the base’s only means of communication with the world. </p>

<p>After the frozen passages opened, a military expedition visited the base to re-establish contact. They found the base’s occupants in various states of madness, rambling about voices in the tree.

<p> “The results are incredible, but more so the speed of discovery this allows us. AI14 copies our speech, but after numerous tests we’ve discovered that certain words are missing from its vocabulary. We began isolating these words, cross-referencing them with esoteric texts from the early days of the Bureau. We found that these words, when arranged in particular formations and spoken at varying speeds and cadences, elicit a reaction from altered materials. </p>

<p>We tested this specific string of words, a “Formula” if you will, on the other Altered Items kept in the Examination Hall. Varying physical responses were recorded with each one, with an 82% success rate. We’ve proven that words can tangibly affect these items. Specific applications must be explored, possibly for containment or identification purposes. This will drastically change our approach moving forward.</p><p>And to think, there are still more words to be found!” </p>

<p>Recently there have been some alarming changes in behavior and altered effect in two Altered Items in the Panopticon. The <em>Arctic Queen</em> and the <em>Pink Flamingo</em> have become much more aggressive, with entirely new effects manifesting for no discernible reason.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>ASTRALNAUT PROGRAM</b></p>



<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>This report serves as an introductory guide to the Astralnaut program including candidate requirements, training practices, and Astral research procedures. </p>

<p>Astralnauts are chosen individuals who explore and document the Astral Plane by making physical contact with the X-Ray Light Box (see case file OOP18 for details) in the Hypnosis Lab, a section of the Parapsychology Division. Physical and psychological training is vital for the repeated transition between planes, known as “dives”. After each dive, Astralnauts must undergo a <em>[REDACTED]</em> session in the cognitive recording chairs to record their experience in the plane.

<p>Gathered data has conclusively proven that <em>[REDACTED</em> <em>REDACTED]</em> within the Astral Plane vary widely between Astralnauts. On rare occasions, these dives can result in losses, often occurring when teams encounter aggressive Astral entities.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>ASTRAL PLANE EXHIBITION</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The Astral Exhibition was originally built for the Astralnauts to use as a training location. A place to grow accustomed to the sights and sounds of the Astral Plane before diving into the real thing. We could have done a better job with it, but <em>[REDACTED]</em> was being stingy with the budget. </p>

<p>However, once we discovered the <em>[REDACTED]</em> we decided to repurpose the space. Similar to how zoos hope familiar surroundings will affect the wellbeing of their animals, we hope to observe the <em>[REDACTED]</em>’ behavior in an environment similar to its home dimension. So far, it just breaks everything we put in with it. But Rome wasn’t built in a day! </p>

<p><u>ADDENDUM:</u></p>

<p>New naming conventions have been established for the Astral entity now known as “Astral Spike”. Outdated terms in this report have been redacted.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>THE ATLAS</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The Atlas is a physical expression created by the Oldest House. Its purpose and function are currently unknown. </p>

<p>The specific shape and dimensions of the Atlas (see file ATL-03 for said dimensions) seem to indicate a more explicit purpose than the Oldest House’s usual walls, floors, or shifts. The Atlas changes form, but resists observation when doing so. No visual observation has been made during its change, and it only ever occurs between frames when monitored by surveillance cameras. </p>

<p>A previous theory was that this change corresponds to House Shifts and that the Atlas is a <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> of the <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> itself. However the shape changes do not occur at the same time as the building shifts, which makes this theory doubtful. </p>

<p>Structurally the Atlas is made of the same <em>[REDACTED]</em> material as the rest of the Oldest House. Further observation will hopefully aid in discovering its purpose. </p>

<p><u>EVENT SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>A response team was dispatched to a possible AWE in progress at <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>, Albany. At the scene, the team encountered and retrieved AI63.</p>

<p><u>EVENT RESPONSE:</u></p>

<p>The Bureau had discovered numerous online message boards regarding loud noises coming from an abandoned shipping warehouse belonging to the <em>[REDACTED]</em> Corporation. Local law enforcement had discovered numerous bodies in various states of mutilation in the vicinity. This, along with the noises, were considered to be evidence of a “werewolf” due to the fact that they only occurred on the last three full moons. </p>

<p>Field Agent <em>REDACTED</em> accompanied a squad of ranger trainees to the site as a form of field training. The likelihood of a genuine AWE was considered low. Despite this evaluation, the team encountered a highly-volatile Altered Item, which they successfully retrieved. </p>

<p><u>DETAILS:</u></p>

<p>Upon arrival, the squad broke into the warehouse and discovered boxes of undelivered merchandise abandoned by the previous owner of the warehouse. As they investigated the noise, <em>[dimensional rupturing]</em> along the south side of the building caused it to collapse inward. Wooden crates in accelerated physical <em>[movement resulting</em> from <em>the item]</em> rendered Field Agent <em>REDACTED</em> and two of the trainees unconscious. The others escaped the warehouse before it collapsed entirely. In the rubble, they found AI63 at the origin of the <em>[lethal altered effect]</em>, attracting and repelling debris. </p>

<p>They stood guard around the item until the moon set, at which point the altered effect ceased. They returned the item to the Bureau without further incident. No fatalities occurred. </p>

<p>The collapse of the warehouse was not witnessed by civilians and thus no re-informing by the Communications Department was required. </p>

opcon_doc_awe_brightfalls_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p><b>Bright Falls (AWE-35)</b></p>

<p><u>EVENT SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>An unconfirmed Threshold manifestation at Cauldron Lake, WA resulted in a fictional story written by the author Alan Wake creating an AWE in which reality was altered to match that of the story, though only locally and for a limited time.</p>

<p><u>EVENT RESPONSE:</u></p>

<p>Mr. Kirklund, Head of Investigations, was alerted on Sept. 13, 2010 by ex-Bureau agent Frank Breaker (see <em>REDACTED</em>) that an AWE event was taking place in Bright Falls, WA (refer to events investigated in 1970, 1976, 1978). Breaker had received a call from Barry Wheeler (Alan Wake’s literary agent) on behalf of Breaker’s daughter, Sarah, who is the current sheriff of Bright Falls.</p>

<p>A Bureau field team arrived at the site two days later, only to confirm that the event was over. Interviews were conducted (refer to the 1970 <em>REDA</em> Thomas Zane; 1976, 1978 Odin Anderson, Tor Anderson). Alan Wake was believed to <em>REDACTED REDACTED</em> instigator. Eyewitness reports highlight an old light switch (possible Object of Power) that <em>REDACTEDREDACTED RED></em> missing. Wake was not found at the scene. Reports claim he dived into the lake, but no body was recovered in the search.</p>

<p><u>DETAILS:</u></p>

<p>Alice Wake, Mr. Wake’s wife, was found during the Bureau investigation. She was interviewed and evaluated. She showed signs of severe mental trauma in the form of <em>REDACTED</em> memory loss. She was later directed to treatment. It was concluded that she had been trapped in the Threshold during its manifestation.</p>

<p>Notable individuals still missing after the Bright Falls event are FBI Special Agent Robert Nightingale and Dr. Emil Hartman (refer to “The Creator’s Dilemma” and the file re: the Cauldron Lake Lodge).</p>

<p>Bureau researchers believe this event was the result of a forceful perception of subjective reality (stemming from Mr. Wake) overlapping on our own. Wake has been flagged as a potential parautilitarian (see Prime Candidate Program file for more details).</p>

<p> In 2011, a book by Clay Steward titled “The Alan Wake Files” was published by Roundabout Press (New York and Olympia). Agents interviewed Clay Steward and suspected minor parautilitarian sensitivity. He was placed under indefinite surveillance.</p>

<p><u>NOTES:</u></p>

<p>A monitoring station was established at Cauldron Lake to alert the Bureau of any future activity.</p>

<p><u>EVENT RESPONSE: </u></p>

<p>Bureau agents arrived at the home of a local celebrity, located at <em>[REDACTED</em> <em>REDACTED REDACTED]</em>, which had been connected to a total of <em>[RED]</em> disappearances in the area. Agents found no one inside. While searching a closet, an agent pulled the light switch cord and disappeared from view.</p>

<p><u>DETAILS:</u></p>

<p>According to their testimony, the agents had been transported from the Butte home to a roadside motel (named the Oceanview Motel and Casino) and discovered a room key by performing a ritual (see file MOT-01). The key opened a door marked with an inverted black pyramid, which they only learned after a lengthy period of trial and error. After pulling another motel cord found inside this room, they were transported to the Oldest House.</p>

<p>The disappearances of the home’s owner and the other locals of Butte have been attributed to the light switch cord. The Oceaniew Motel is now known to have many doors and pathways.</p>

<p>Since the occurrence, identical light switch cords to the one found in the Butte home have begun appearing throughout the Oldest House. At the time of writing, <em>[RE]</em> light cords have been found in the Oldest House, located in the <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>, and <em>[REDACTED]</em> Sectors. These all access the Oceanview Motel, though how exactly this link operates is <em>[REDACTED]</em> but initial hypotheses center on the Butte AWE as a <em>[REDACTED RED</em> <em>REDACTE</em> (see Dr. Darling presentation 24.3 for more details).</p>

<p><u>EVENT SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>An AWE occurred in the town of Ordinary, caused by an Object of Power (Slide Projector, ID: OOP15) discovered by local children at the dump outside of town. When a specific set of slides are used in the Projector, the projected images open doorways to other dimensions. Multiple slides were used by the children, resulting in the disappearance of the town’s adult population.</p>

<p><u>EVENT RESPONSE:</u></p>

<p>On Aug. 30, 2002, siblings Dylan Faden (10-years-old, see P6 materials) and Jesse Faden (11-years-old, see P7 materials) were playing at the local dump when they found a discarded Slide Projector (see OOP15 case file and Darling presentations <em>RED</em> for details).</p>

<p>A team led by Director Trench and Dr. Darling arrived at the site on Sept. 14. The AWE had ended, but the team found the Faden children, who led them to the Slide Projector and the slides, which had been burned with the exception of one. Jesse escaped when agents attempted to detain the pair.</p>

<p>In total, 17 surviving individuals were found in the town. All of them were brought in for questioning and tests (see interviews <em>REDACTED</em> and Prime Candidate Program files <em>REDACD</em>).</p>

<p><u>DETAILS:</u></p>

<p>Details are largely based on interviews conducted with Dylan Faden (see interviews <em>REDACTED RED</em> and <em>DACTED</em> for relevant information) and the obtained therapy sessions of Jesse Faden, as well as circumstantial evidence found at the Ordinary site. Note that accounts provided by all three sources contain conflicting data. Example: D.F. claims there were eight slides for the projector. J.F. mentioned nine slides. The Bureau found one intact slide (designation: 36) and the burnt remains of six others. Unfortunately, these slides are too badly damaged to be used in the Projector.</p>

<p>Jesse Faden is believed to be the individual responsible for burning the slides.</p>

<p><u>NOTES:</u></p>

<p>Dr. Darling has ordered that the entirety of the Ordinary town dump be brought to the Bureau for examination and analysis, with the hopes of finding additional slides or other altered materials.</p>

<p>Due to the limited space in the Investigations Sector, this AWE will be investigated in the Containment Sector.</p>

<p><u>DETAILS:</u></p>

<p>Local witnesses report a bright flash in the field, at approximately <em>[REDACTED]</em>. No noise accompanied the light.</p>

<p>Authorities had assumed the object fell from the sky, but our examination found the object actually manifested there, vaporizing the soil around it in an intense spherical <em>[REDACTED</em> <em>REDA]</em>, which possibly explains the light seen from the town.</p>

<p>The object is a hollow sphere made of a stone-like material. Structural analysis of the material does not <em>[REDACTED</em> <em>REDACTED]</em> on record. The sphere has a broken portion, as if something <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> from the object. The object has been inactive since arriving at the Bureau.</p>

<p>The Communications Department officially stated to the press that the object was a small meteor, while also using the America Overnight program to <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> (see episode 92).</p>

<p>NOTE: This AWE will be studied in the Containment Sector until the spherical object is deemed safe to be transferred to the Investigations Sector.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>AWE FREQUENCY</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>For some time now there has been a steady increase in the annual number of AWEs that the Bureau responds to. Between 2010 and 2015 we responded to <em>[REDACTED]</em> AWEs. For comparison, note that we only responded to <em>[REDACTED]</em> between 1995 and 2005. </p>

<p>Is this rise a result of <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>, improvement in our detection procedures, or perhaps simply coincidence? We cannot say for sure, which is why this proposal for an AWE Task Force to be created within the hierarchy of the Investigations Sector has been compiled. We need to spend more time examining what <u>causes</u> AWEs rather than just containing them. </p>

opcon_doc_bookclub_02_DESCRIPTION1: <p>Book Club Thoughts</p>

<p>By Phillip P. </p>

<p>“Unless You” hooked me right away. It began with visceral dismemberment scenes, and this great unsettling vibe created by the unexplained creature they named “the Fix”. </p>

<p>As an avid horror fan, I loved how this story veered from the genre conventions into something a little more, for lack of a better word, weird. Everything felt familiar, but just a little off. The characters even comment on it, saying how their lives felt out of control, as if they were just programmed to perform the same empty actions over and over. Very meta.</p>

<p>And I loved the way they left the ending wide-open. What happened to the guy ordered to watch those monitors for the rest of his life? Did the Fix get him? Is he dead? Did he end up in the parallel reality with the others? We don’t know. And that’s okay.</p>

<p>All in all an interesting read. I’ll give it a solid 4/5. Points deducted for some of the clunky dialogue and unbelievable choices the characters made. I mean, who the hell would follow orders from their boss in the middle of such a horrible slaughterfest? But I guess I shouldn’t demand too much realism from a work of fiction.</p>

<p>By L. Samson</p>

<p>So I don’t usually read a lot of sci-fi, but as far as space operas go, this was all right. The title “Unless You” could refer to a bunch of things in the book, I guess, but I thought it was a little vague and stupid. The way the characters kept throwing it around almost like a catchphrase got real annoying real fast. </p>

<p>The best part of the story was the space battles. I sided with the Fixers, obviously, because they had the coolest tech and their motives made the most sense to me. Honestly, if I had to choose between some hoity-toity flowers-in-guns space hippies or a bad-ass bunch of warriors who go around devouring planets like cheap sushi on a Sunday, I know who I’m picking. That scene where they invade city-planet and convert the entire population using those brain worms? And that space dog fight between those two ace pilots? Sign me the fuck up. </p>

<p>What kind of ruined the whole thing for me was when my favorite character got killed not even halfway through the story by getting a battery cylinder launched into his face by a gravitational anomaly. His death didn’t feel necessary at all. </p>

<p>2/5</p>

opcon_doc_bookclub_04_DESCRIPTION1: <p>“Unless You” – review by Cpt. Lopez</p>

<p>These days, most YA novels intertwine the “coming of age” story with either a contrived dystopian setting or a tragic romance. “Unless You” managed to do both. </p>

<p>In the story, the protagonist and her love interest search for a cure to a virus called “the Fix”, which is simultaneously killing her and spreading across the whole world. To find the cure, they go on expeditions into dangerous, uncharted territories (the people all live in walled cities now because dystopian future), and along the way they just have to fall in love. </p>

<p>I liked how we never got to know if the Fix was ever actually… fixed. The ending was bold, especially for YA. The main character succumbs to the Fix when she’s so close to the cure and commands her love interest to go on and save the world. She knows this is the end for her, but that the job can still get done. She dies out in the unknown, alone and surrounded by danger, but never loses sight of the goal. That’s a good soldier’s death. </p>

<p>I give this book 3/5. I feel most of the teenage angst is a little lost on me, but I’d recommend it to my brother’s kids. </p>

<p>Dear Dr. Darling, </p>

<p>I suspect my colleague Dr. Harrington has already contacted you asking for an increase in her department’s budget. I’m not surprised. Parapsychology has always been the squeaky wheel, all fuss but no results. Parakinesiology has always been the stronger department. More breakthroughs, more tangible data, more usable research. </p>

<p>I’m sure a man of your esteem can plainly see which department is more deserving of the budget increase. Just think what those additional resources could do for an already formidable research team. </p>

<p>Anyway, I know you’re a fan of single malt so I left a bottle of well-aged brown on your desk. </p>

<p>Yours in Admiration, </p>

<p>Hi Carla, </p>

<p>Does it strike you as odd that Darling insists on having us appear in those bizarre videos of his? I mean, we just stand there, he doesn’t even let us have lines or anything. Don’t get me wrong – beats a day in the lab. Plus it’s always great to work with you. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, I finished the comparative analysis of the two Black Rock samples you sent. The prism or whatever you called it. I filed them in the usual place, under C for Carla. A handy mnemonic device, right? Ha ha. </p>

<p>Anyway, let me know if there’s anything you want to discuss about the data. I’ll gladly explain! Maybe we could chat about it over some drinks, or dinner even. I can’t remember the last time I had a good steak! Maybe we could go together after work sometime? I’m free tomorrow. </p>

<p><u>RE-INFORMATION CAMPAIGN SUMMARY OF WILLOW AWE</u></p>

<p>National news sites have begun publishing the story of the polar bear attack on the Alaskan town. You all know I don’t like to boast, but claiming that the family was killed by migrating polar bears desperate for food because their ecosystem is being ruined by global warming was a stroke of genius. Using current ecological concerns makes the public much less likely to <em>REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED</em>. </p>

<p>So, another AWE behind us and the public is none the wiser. Well done, everyone. It was a strong campaign and perfectly executed. This doesn’t mean we can stop monitoring <em>[REDACTED</em> <em>REDACTED]</em> and <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> for any off-message opinions, but it’s looking like we’re in the clear. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>CONTROL POINTS</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Control Points are locations that the Bureau has identified as being vital junctions of the Oldest House. When the appropriate harmonization devices are arranged around the Control Point in the <em>[REDACTED]</em> arrangement, the surrounding area will not experience any unforeseen Building Shifts. </p>

<p>These Control Points are discovered by <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> detection of an unobstructed ping using the <em>[REDACTED]</em> within a 37 foot radius. Numerous researchers have attempted to define Control Points, calling them nerve junctures or <em>[REDACTED]</em> or vulnerable spots of the Oldest House. The common factor in these theories is that Control Points are susceptible to external influence, which allows us to stabilize the Oldest House and work more confidently inside it. </p>

<p>Theoretically, this technology could be extrapolated to stabilize the Oldest House as a whole, but testing has found that certain parts of the building refuse to be <em>[REDACTED]</em>. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>THE ASTRAL PLANE AND OBJECTS OF POWER</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u> </p>

<p>The Bureau has spent years studying why Objects of Power transport users into the Astral Plane when touched. My predecessor, Dr. Ash, theorized that a potential receptacle (determined by Jungian archetypes and the collective subconscious) would be inhabited by paranatural energies when an AWE occurred in its vicinity, creating an Altered Item. Over time, a link was created by the <em>[REDACTED]</em> and the Astral Plane to that item, making it an Object of Power. </p>

<p>So many additional theories have been raised since Dr. Ash’s time. Objects of Power were placed on Earth as tests by some Astral entity. Our dimension was once part of the Astral Plane, and the Objects were left behind as its borders receded. The Astral Plane was an early Threshold into the Oldest House, but the connection was severed and now the two are linked solely through the Objects of Power. </p>

<p>I will attempt to disprove some of these in order to thin the herd. Hopefully, the truth will emerge. </p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Black Rock has allowed the Bureau to make great strides in containment procedures since it was first discovered. This report will examine how its very structure is comprised of <em>[REDACTED]</em> density that nullifies all resonances with a range of <em>[RED]</em> to <em>[REDA]</em>Hz. Bureau innovations that incorporate Black Rock will be analyzed, most notably the Firebreaks: feats of engineering designed to contain any future outbreaks, attacks, or other internal threats. </p>

<p>Resonance. It’s there, but we can’t see it. It vibrates around us, through us, from us. But what if the vibration is conscious? What could a force like that do? </p>

The <em>[REDACTED]</em> emits a force that is far beyond the forces we’ve previously dealt with. It has shown me so much that I have to wonder. Is resonance the key element in all altered phenomenon? AWEs, Altered Items, Objects of Power, do they share a common <em>[REDACTED]</em> that we’ve yet to discover? We can harmonize Control Points, what else would the correct frequency allow us to achieve? What if resonance has been the answer this whole time? </p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Thresholds have always been sources of great inspiration and great challenge.

This report will examine the process of distinguishing recent Threshold effects based on their utilitarian possibilities. </p>

<p>The Quarry brought Black Rock, one of our most invaluable discoveries, but if the Mold has any scientific value, it has been difficult to find due to the lengths we must go to in fighting back the particularly prolific plant. These are very distinct cases and worth comparing as their study offers vastly different dangers and rewards. </p>

opcon_doc_deadletter_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p>To Whom it May Concern,</p>

 <p>I am being contacted by the past Presidents of the United States of America. They appear as spirit guides, giving me their wisdom. John Adams keeps saying I need to fix America, but I can’t really understand him. They all have a lot of opinions. </p>

<p>People tell me I’m imagining it but Theodore Roosevelt showed me how to fix my lawnmower and I don’t know a thing about lawnmowers. Explain that! </p>

<p>I have great dead men telling me about the past and the present. If you’d like to use my abilities to help run the government, please let me know. I know the White House could use me. </p>

<p>Yours in earnest, </p>

<p>James Bartholomew</p>

opcon_doc_deadletter_02_DESCRIPTION1: <p>I had a Dream and I built the thing I saw in my dream. A machine that will contain God, but not the God you know or the ones anyone knows. A new God. This machine will be his body, his heart, and his mind. I made it just like the Dream showed me.</p>

<p>I used the motor from the refrigerator and the coils from my toaster and the fans plus the timing belt from my car’s engine and the wheels from my son’s skateboard. God can’t move yet, but the dream said he would learn how on his own. This is just a beginner’s body. Like a baby’s but a machine instead. God only needs a place to start.</p>

<p>If you want to interview me, please contact me at the address on the envelope. My phone does not work anymore. I had to use the dialing plate on God.</p>

opcon_doc_deadletter_04_DESCRIPTION1: <p>Dear Gentlemen of the Society of Sciences,</p>

<p>It has been some time since I sent my initial letter. I hope it is not the case that you have dismissed my claims outright. In that hope, I am writing you to once more ask for your help in understanding the oddity that has befallen me in my home. </p>

<p>I have recently begun renting a new apartment in the city. The space is nothing special, though for a time I found the isolation quite soothing. Recently, I have begun experiencing a strange occurrence. When I’m in my kitchen, a tiny little thing with not much but a sink, I sometimes lose myself. My surroundings change. I find myself standing on strange dark stone. I stare out at a colorless sky, as white as undisturbed snow, terrified of moving. </p>

<p>Perhaps this is a brain issue? I think not, as it feels terribly real. This has been occurring for some months now and I have become frightened of entering the kitchen. If it’s not too much of an inconvenience, I would dearly appreciate a visit from one of your professionals to see what they make of it. </p>

<p>I await your response with little expectation, but with great hope. </p>

<p>Very Truly Yours, </p>

<p>Lorraine Fitzgerald</p>

<p>Airplanes aren’t real. I figured out how they do it. </p>

<p>The windows are TV screens. The whole thing moves on big tracks like a rollercoaster that moves through underground tunnels in the Earth. Airports are more like train stations. </p>

<p>They do this because the sky is full of monsters that they don’t want us to know about. The planes we see in the sky are the monsters. The government made the Earth-trains look like the monsters so they could lie to us better. </p>

opcon_doc_deadletter_06_DESCRIPTION1: <p>Dear Elected Official,</p>

<p>Thanks to the recent smoking ban in my state, I am happy to inform you I will not be voting for you in the next election. </p>

<p>As everyone knows, smoking is being banned because the smoke is toxic to the aliens that the government sold our planet to in a secret deal. If humans keep smoking, the aliens won’t be able to live on Earth. Our air would be poison to them. If you government traitors can’t stop people from smoking then you won’t get your millions of dollars from the aliens. </p>

<p>I have a website. People know what’s going on. We’re going to keep smoking, no matter what. This is a national emergency. Politicians are handing the planet over to alien overlords. We won’t let you. We will resist. </p>

<p>I will smoke forever! </p>

opcon_doc_deadletter_09_DESCRIPTION1: <p>To the Esteemed Members of the American Psychiatric Council,</p>

<p>I am writing you to inquire about the significance of dreams in relation to one’s mental health? I am aware that there are many books purporting to contain the True meanings of dreams, but I have reservations about their legitimacy. </p>

<p>I understand that this is not usually done, but if I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on my Condition. Ever since I was young, I have had intensely-vivid dreams. They only occur sporadically, but in them I witness very strange events. I understand dreams can seem real at the time, but these feel markedly different. They do not occur often, perhaps only one or two a year. </p>

<p>Last night I had one. I saw a small, empty town. It was utterly dark. There was a Lake at its center. Shadows of people moved around me, muttering odd things. A bright light woke me up. I was screaming in my sleep. My wife had been shaking me for minutes before I woke. </p>

<p>Because of this recent incident, I have decided to seek help. The doctor says I am physically fine, but I wanted to consult your Expertise. Thank you for your valuable time. </p>

<p>Yours Very Sincerely, </p>

<p>Richard Bowker</p>

<p>Greetings Director Trench,</p>

<p>I’d like to thank you for approving my request for the Dead Letters Archive. Cataloging the Bureau’s collection of delinquent mail will provide an extremely handy database that research teams can use to search for any connections or related topics found among the letters.</p>

<p>Aside from the more functional purposes, the archive will allow us to preserve these windows into authentic human encounters with the paranatural world. The letters came to us from various places and times, gathered by the Postal Service as undeliverable. The Bureau is the perfect home for them. I realize not all letters contain accounts of genuine paranatural events, but even the erroneous ones allow us insight into how the unknown is perceived by real people.</p>

<p>Of course, I will first compile a system to allow us to analyze the letters for any information or suspected connections to AWEs and other altered materials. </p>

<p>So thank you again! Can’t wait to delve into my dead letters!</p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Dr. Yoshimi Tokui, a Japanese citizen residing in Tokyo, has produced a series of “guided imagery experience” audio recordings that have gained notable popularity around the globe. Due to his unusually swift rise in fame, along with reports of vivid <em>[REDACTED]</em> accompanying the use of his tapes, Investigations Sector staff were asked to look into Dr. Tokui’s background.</p>

<p>We found no past incident with an altered occurrence, nor any evidence of involvement with an altered organization. However, agents that attended a signing event reported <em>[REDACTED RE]</em> when hearing Dr. Tokui speak.</p>

<p>We recommend that the Research team obtain an audio recording of Dr. Tokui’s voice and perform any and all relevant analyses. Based on the findings, the Investigations Sector will determine next steps regarding Dr. Tokui, as well as his eligibility for the Prime Candidate Program.</p>

<p>To all Executive Staff,</p>

<p>I know there is some concern regarding our operations exceeding the annual budget. So long as we operate within the Oldest House, we are obscured from scrutiny in many respects. If our budget demands are not exorbitant to the point of drawing attention, then they will be granted by the U.S. Treasury without question. The FBC is just another line in another spreadsheet that some lowly accountant won’t even notice. Their eyes will skip over us, as if we weren’t even there. </p>

opcon_doc_formation_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p align=CENTER><b>EXAMINATION OF PARANATURAL TOPICS</b></p>

<p align=CENTER><b>INTERWOVEN CAUSALITY OF THE FORMATION</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The Formation is a tall stone structure found in Quarry Site Beta, only reachable by placing distinct tokens into the Jukebox Object of Power (see OOP10 case file for details). The Formation's exact purpose is <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>, but we can at least examine its relationship with the <em>[REDACTED]</em> surrounding it. </p>

<p>Measuring devices found trace evidence of <em>[REDAC</em> <em>REDACTED]</em> at certain lines running from the Formation to the <em>[REDACTED]</em>. When examined properly, four direct ritual tethers were detected. Some form of sympathetic causality connects the Formation with the <em>[REDACTED]</em> which means, in theory, that when certain <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> are performed at one, it will physically affect the other. I've been urged to note here that some individuals believe the Formation responds to any fulfilment of purpose or desire in nearby individuals (though I'd like to remind those individuals that we're the Parakinesiology Department, not the Para-Feelings Department).</p>

<p>I'm proud to report that my team was able to design, construct, and install a permanent detection system. These arches will help Rangers identify when the causal tethers are active, allowing them to better <em>[REDACTED REDACTED RED]</em>. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>RE-THINKING GROUPTHINK</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>This study extends the works of Irving Janis, Robert Baron and others by proposing strong, causal links between groupthink and the passive or active use of telepathy. To prove these connections, the Parapsychology Department carried out variations of Solomon Asch’s original conformity experiments using a telepathic individual as the subject (see experiments <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> for details). Extensive qualitative and quantitative data resulting from these experiments was then used to identify telepathic interference within the group. Further empirical findings suggest measures can be taken to safeguard against telepathic influence on behaviors by engaging in <em>[REDACTED REDACTE REDACTED]</em>. Rather boldly, this paper stands to revolutionize decades of groupthink theory and provide new directions for further experimentation on the mind, including manipulation of <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> and <em>[REDACTED]</em>.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The Hiss manifest in human hosts in numerous ways. The most common and least intense form is seen in the many corrupted agents floating throughout the Bureau.</p>

<p>The Hiss Agents have maintained their human appearance, undergoing no obvious physical transformation. The most notable distinction from an unaffected human is the fact that they levitate.</p>

<p>These Hiss have displayed no aggressive behavior. They only seem interested in vocalizing the strange incantation ad infinitum. Perhaps these vessels are only meant to propagate the Hiss corruption, like spores or wi-fi boosters. Or are they cocoons, preparing to enter their next stage of evolution? When attacked, Hiss Agents disappear, perhaps entering a state of invisibility or undergoing a transformation into a purely resonant form? Research is ongoing.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The Bureau has many internal security personnel. The Hiss was quick to take advantage of this fact. </p>

<p>Hiss Guards use the standard-issue “bullpup” rifles they carried prior to corruption, while the armored guards carry pump-action shotguns. They have no observed paranatural abilities, with the exception that certain Hiss Guards are protected by a shielding of dense Hiss resonance, capable of stopping bullets. Is this shielding a result of prolonged Hiss corruption? Does the Hiss mature in organic hosts over time? More data is needed. </p>

<p>Did the Hiss target individuals with combat training? Does the Hiss have that level of cognizance? Does it utilize hosts for tasks they are best suited to? Combat-trained hosts are reserved for combat? These are all questions for later, though it is obvious that corrupted individuals retain knowledge on the use of their weapons. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The Rangers are the Bureau’s well-trained and well-armed expeditionary forces. Their Hiss-corrupted counterparts are equally formidable.</p>

<p>Prior to corruption, Rangers were trained to use a variety of weapons in order to face any threat found during AWE response or Threshold exploration, including sub-machine guns, assault rifles, and automatic shotguns. Hiss Rangers utilize these weapons as well as the advanced tactics taught by Bureau instructors. Some are additionally outfitted with Bureau-made body armor. Hiss Rangers have no observed paranatural abilities beyond some being protected by a shielding of dense Hiss resonance, capable of stopping bullets.</p>

<p>Considering the advanced training the Hiss Rangers are capable of applying to their situation, is it feasible to consider the human mind still remains intact to some degree? Or is the Hiss able to tap into this combat training and utilize it? Further observation is required.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The Hiss Charged Agents are examples of extreme physical deformation resulting from Hiss corruption.</p>

<p>Hiss Charged display an unthinking fixation on any non-corrupted individuals in the area. Once within a specific proximity, they erupt into a burst of focused Hiss resonance, so dense that it acts as a physical force. The Hiss Charged is depleted of the Hiss corruption after this eruption. The host is left lifeless.</p>

<p>This behavior may be an adaptive response to the HRAs. The Hiss Charged are designed to blow the devices off potential hosts, exposing them to the resonance. Is the Hiss capable of customizing a corrupted host’s altered ability to this degree? Why is the physiology of the Hiss Charged so dramatically different from the host’s original form? Lots of questions, no answers.</p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Troopers are meant to be the first agents to enter unknown AWEs, Thresholds, or any other paranaturally hazardous situation. They are heavily armored and heavily armed in preparation for the worst.</p>

<p>As a result of their role, Hiss Troopers have access to the heaviest armor and weaponry from the Bureau’s armory, including military grade chain guns and grenade launchers. In addition to their already formidable FBC-issued armor, the Hiss resonance surrounding these entities is dense enough to stop bullets. If forced to engage one of these, be sure to make use of any available cover. Also note that, to the telekinetically-talented, enemy grenades can be a welcome source of ammunition.</p>

<p>Bureau snipers specialize in eliminating threats from a distance, using the telltale searchlights affixed to their rifles to search for targets.</p>

<p>Hiss Snipers are no less lethal. The corruption has not changed their tactics. They clearly prefer to maintain a good distance from their target, waiting in elevated positions for a clear shot.

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u> </p>

<p>Hiss Elevated Agents display abilities similar to telekinetic competencies observed in Bureau parautilitarians. Some prefer to charge their targets, while others launch objects at them. Telekinetic attacks have been ineffective against the Hiss Elevated, due to their own talent in the area. They do not use any weaponry except their own paranatural capabilities. Some Hiss Elevated have been seen levitating while strapped into chairs. This is likely the result of individuals being corrupted while undergoing cognitive recording in Parapsychology.</p>

<p>How are they able to use paranatural abilities? It is possible that these individuals were bound to Objects of Power prior to corruption. It’s also worth considering that the Hiss resonance can identify and express latent paranatural ability in the individuals it corrupts.</p>

<p>The Hiss Warped wield only paranatural abilities, similar to Drifters. They are able to telekinetically shield themselves with nearby material and launch objects at their target. These entities are particularly destructive and difficult to kill, possibly indicating a greater internal reinforcement of Hiss resonance. </p>

<p>Why do certain Hiss display paranatural abilities while others rely on Bureau firearms? Do certain corrupted entities have less potential than the hosts that become Hiss Warped? Or is this perhaps an indication of evolution or maturation of the Hiss corruption? Are there other stages of evolution yet to be found? What if the Hiss inhabits a host for a month? A year? Do hosts expire after a certain amount of time? Does the corruption become too strong for an organic body to endure? Only time (and well-documented observation) will tell.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Hiss Distorted Agents are able to render themselves invisible and emit a powerful concussive blast when in close range of their target. Curiously, the Hiss Distorted is apparently not able to utilize both abilities at once. It must make itself visible when it goes on the offensive. </p>

<p>The Hiss Distorted is unique in the fact that it wields a paranatural ability previously unknown to the Bureau (perhaps tapping into a yet undiscovered Object of Power?). How does this invisibility work? Does the Distorted become resonance temporarily? Does it use Hiss resonance to refract light?</p>

<p>The physical deformation of this particular Hiss entity is noteworthy in its thoroughness. Clearly the human host would have died from such extreme alteration, which prompts the question: Are the corrupted simply animated corpses?</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Hiss Clusters are unique in that they are concentrated manifestations of Hiss resonance without the need of a host.</p>

<p>Hiss Clusters are dense spherical compressions of Hiss resonance that serve support functions in the hierarchy of Hiss entities. The Clusters are capable of replenishing Hiss hosts with infusions of resonance. This does not heal any physical damage inflicted on the organic host, but rather seems to rejuvenate them, allowing them to endure more bodily harm than normally possible.</p>

<p>The fact that the Hiss makes an effort to preserve its corrupted hosts underlines a level of awareness and discretion that was previously just speculation on my part. Can this entity be considered an individual or simply an extension of the Hiss as a whole? Capturing one “alive” would be quite interesting.</p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The Hiss resonance field is a physical impediment that is difficult to define.</p>

<p>Hiss Barriers appear as ways to impede escape or access by Bureau personnel. Two methods have been discovered for lowering them. 1) Destroy the multiple concentrated resonance sources found in the vicinity. 2) Destroy the Hiss entities in the area.</p>

<p>The resonance fields seem to require support for their size and density from other, non-connected sources of Hiss resonance. Without the ability to draw from these sources, the Barrier will fall.</p>

<p>Does an inactive structure made of Hiss resonance qualify as a conscious being? Does the distinction make any difference when considering the Hiss? What does the very act of building walls to prevent our movement tell us about the Hiss? To what degree is it watching and planning?</p>

<p>Hiss Demolition Experts are the only observed Hiss variations to wield the specially-built rocket propelled grenade that is designed to identify and track <em>paranatural</em> entities once fired, making them a threat whose termination should be prioritized in combat scenarios.</p>

<p>I find it remarkable that the Hiss restrict usage of this weapon to the Bureau personnel who trained specifically for its use. What does this tell us about its behavior? Can it not pass along new information to corrupted entities? Still too many unknowns.</p>

<p>Thank you for the file. It was very helpful. I’ve re-archived it with the Black Rock research in case you need to refer to them again.</p>

<p>Yes, the video shoots are always interesting. I expect my availability for those to decrease in the future, however, as my analysis of this newly discovered Black Rock variant is reaching a critical point. I hope you will be able to attend them still. Darling seems to be under a lot of pressure lately, and I’m sure he would appreciate any support you can provide. </p>

<p>Regarding the analysis you provided, I do not have any questions. Thank you for the expeditious delivery. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>URBAN LEGENDS</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Urban legends are believed to affect the creation of altered materials, but can also dictate the characteristics of an Altered World Event. </p>

<p>Urban legends are understood as the modern evolution of Jung’s archetypes. We recognize certain <em>[REDACTED]</em>, informed by our own <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> and popularized by our media. We have additionally proven that urban legends can even be artificially <em>[REDACTED]</em> in popular culture using <em>[REDACTED]</em> (our Bureau-made anthology television program). Once the seeds are sown, human imagination exacerbates the details. </p>

<p>Certain paranatural phenomena contain clear elements of popularized folklore. AWEs that only occur on <em>[REDACTED]</em>. A pair of scissors that consume human <em>[REDACD]</em> through two punctures on the <em>[REDA]</em>. These details, living in the minds of so many, have been given strength through belief. </p>

<p>Urban legends are not just stories for children. They are paranatural realities waiting to happen. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>RE: QUARRY OPERATIONS</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>During my weekly safety inspection to the Quarry Threshold, I discovered the entire crew in a state of <em>[REDACTED]</em>. The whole team was <em>[REDACTED]</em>, aligned and staring in a uniform direction; the City in the distance. Despite my most vocal efforts to gain their attention, they remained <em>[REDACTED]</em> for more than <em>[REDACTED]</em> minutes until I had to resort to literally <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>. Afterwards, they were dazed and could not provide any rationale for their behavior or any specific memories of engaging in it.</p>

<p>My official recommendation for any crew working in a Threshold area is to either shorten the length of their shifts or to carry out mandatory psychological evaluations on a weekly basis – or preferably both.</p>

<p>And maybe we should order another expedition to the City.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>OBJECT OF POWER AND ALTERED ITEM DISTINCTIONS</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>While Altered Items and Objects of Power may seem similar at first, it’s important to note some very key distinctions. </p>

<p>Firstly, Objects of Power grant parautilitarian abilities (see file PUT-812 for an introduction to the subject). </p>

<p>Secondly, Objects of Power translocate anyone who makes physical contact to the Astral Plane. This is widely believed to be due to the <em>[REDACTED]</em>’s affiliation with Objects of Power. Not every individual is allowed in the Astral Plane, which indicates the <em>[REDACTED]</em> evaluates who can or cannot enter. </p>

<p>Thirdly, and this is not always the case, Objects of Power are much more paranaturally <em>[REDACTED]</em> than Altered Items. </p>

<p>Looking at the specific criteria that defines an Object of Power, it is no wonder they are notably rarer than Altered Items. In fact, we have <em>[REDACTED]</em> Altered Items for every Object of Power contained within the Bureau. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>PANOPTICON CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES PROPOSAL</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>In this proposal, I’d like to explore the matter of containment policy. When an Altered Item enters the Oldest House, we thoroughly investigate any possible combination of actions or words or material that will prevent the item from applying its altered effect.</p>

<p>However, I work with these entities every day and I have good reason to believe that a less convoluted form of containment is possible. The items crave <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>. If we initiated a series of <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> praising the items, or perhaps incorporating their images into pieces of <em>[REDA]</em> that could be visited throughout the Bureau, I believe the Altered Items would behave without needing to resort to <em>[REDACTEDED]</em> or <em>[REDACT]</em>, which only lead to the items feeling mistreated. </p>

<p>If we treat them like criminals, we can’t be surprised when they try to escape. </p>

opcon_doc_lockdown_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p align=CENTER><b>FEDERAL BUREAU OF CONTROL</b></p>

<p>Pay attention, Alberto. This is the last time I’m explaining this.</p>

<p>Internal lockdowns are manually triggered events that lock one or all of the sectors by restricting use of the Sector Elevator, effectively locking staff in their sector until the emergency is handled. They can only be lifted via the Directorial Override in Maintenance once the Director is satisfied that the situation is under control.</p>

<p>External lockdowns are a bigger deal. Nothing in or out of the whole building. It’s only triggered by a code red containment breach, based on some complicated system that security and research slapped together. It can only be lifted once A) the threat has been neutralized and B) a high clearance individual gives the system the all clear. This process is NOT the same as the Directorial Override, so stop saying so in documentation!</p>

<p>I know it’s confusing as hell. I’ve told Darling a hundred times to change it, but they’re adamant it stays the way it is. Honestly I don’t think they even know how to change it at this point. Let’s just make sure our staff understand how this mess all works, OK? </p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>AI60, the Mirror, does not reflect its surroundings with perfect accuracy. The environment seen in its glass contains slight distinctions. </p>

<p>It is unknown why the Mirror does this, if there is any <em>[REDACTED</em> <em>DACTED]</em> then it’s something we can’t perceive. The popular theory is that the Mirror has a goal in mind, that it reflects the world it wishes were real, subtly replacing our reality with its own. While certainly far-fetched, the theory is worth noting here as a warning not to underestimate the Mirror. The specially-designed Black Rock panels have been installed to prevent access, from our side or the Mirror’s. For added security, a particular arrangement of the panels is required to open the door. </p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>This proposal is to finally determine the precise nature of the “reflected” space within the Altered Item. Is it transplanar, psychologically-generated, or rooted within our own dimension? How does the Altered Item “know” the space in its vicinity well enough to reflect it? Why does it reflect some materials, but not others? </p>

<p>Is the space a parallel reality? If so, then we need to consider that while we possess this physical end of the Mirror, someone else owns the other. What purposes might they use it for? Can they walk through into our own world? What are their motives? </p>

<p>Lastly, to what purpose does the Altered Item produce the reflections of individuals that enter it? Can these reflected entities leave the Altered Item? As with all Altered Items, we need to attempt to distinguish if this behavior is <em>[REDACTED REDACTED</em> <em>REDACTED]</em>. </p>

<p>The deceased was a <em>[RED]</em>-year-old <em>[REDACTED]</em> with no significant past medical history. The subject was brought in after being discovered in the Active Threshold, in an early state of decay that is characteristically fungal-based in its appearance.</p>

<p>During autopsy, the cadaver’s pleural cavities were revealed to be entirely filled by the fungus known as the Mold, to an extent that medical staff were forced to put on decontamination suits. The procedure was also hindered by anomalies such as the deceased’s high body temperature and undulating torso muscles presumably, but not provably, caused by trapped gases. Routine samples, as well as tissue samples requested by Dr. Underhill, were successfully extracted, however their rapid retrogression outside of the host body needs to be noted.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>ACTIVE THRESHOLD/MOLD RESEARCH</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>So you want to know how my Mold research is getting on, Casper? Here it is: </p>

<p>Microscopic organisms, similar in appearance to <em>[REDAC]</em>, construct the architecture of the Mold. I do not understand if these <em>[REDACT</em> are the original disseminators of the Mold or are bidden by some fungal infection. The Mold is the most prolific and durable organism I have ever seen. I theorize there is a Mold source located somewhere on our side of the Threshold, rooted here to accelerate growth in our dimension. I refer to this yet unknown source as Mold-1. </p>

<p>The Mold produces an enticing aroma to encourage human consumption of itself. It propagates in the chest cavity and quickly subsumes the entire body, seizing control of motor functions. This behavior was not observed when I first arrived, which means the Mold has adapted to our presence, targeting our biological imperatives as a way to spread. It is a truly ingenious little thing. </p>

<p>A full report will be ready soon. Keep your slacks on. </p>

<p>Even though the Quarry area is technically an outdoor space, it is still a part of the Bureau and therefore the no smoking rule does apply. </p>

<p>Not only is it considerate towards your fellow employees to refrain from inflicting the harm of second-hand smoke, it is also prudent to avoid any risk of gas fires, unforeseen Threshold reactions, and possible creation of altered receptacles (UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD CIGARETTE BUTTS BE LEFT IN THE QUARRY). </p>

<p align=CENTER> <em>NORTHMOOR</em><b>SARCOPHAGUS CONTAINER (NSC)</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The NSC was designed by order of Deputy Chief Trench shortly before he became Director. The container provides a safe method of extraction of <em>[REDACTED]</em>’s excess energy output while acting as a humane way to house him.</p>

<p>The coolant pumps keep the container (and its <em>[REDACTED]</em>) from overheating while the energy is siphoned. The energy is then conducted to the converters, where it is rendered into a <em>[REDCD]</em> through the use of turbine generators. The electricity produced powers the entire Bureau, making us completely self-sufficient and effectively invisible on the New York City grid. </p>

<p>After NSC-01’s disappearance by some unknown manifestation of <em>[REDACTED]</em>’s power, the occupant was restrained and a second model was built. NSC-02 possesses built-in spatial anchors that are designed to prevent any translocative effect from its occupant. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>OBJECTS OF POWER AND THEIR PARAUTILITY</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Objects of Power are unique in their capacity to grant certain individuals paranatural abilities. We call these individuals “parautilitarians”. </p>

<p>The potency of these abilities depends on the parautilitarian. Using the <em>[REDACTED]</em> Object of Power as an example, some parautilitarians can achieve a throw distance of <em>[REDACTED]</em> while others are only capable of as little as <em>[REDD]</em> (see Dr. Darling presentation 11.15 for more information). </p>

<p>What exactly determines an individual’s paranatural competence is unknown, but it is largely believed that some <em>[CTED REDACTED]</em> exists within the body and that, like all muscles, it can be exercised. To continue my analysis, I have officially requested access to the Northmoor records, considering he is one of the most accomplished parautilitarians the Bureau has ever seen. Dr. Darling is still considering this request. </p>

In the dreams everything was melting, and then, when we’d come out, everything had melted around the projector.” – J.F. (therapy session, 2010)</p>

<p>Incident in question occurred on <em>[REDACTED]</em> and was brought to HR Department’s attention by the internal security personnel who intervened.</p>

<p>According to reports supported by security camera footage, Agent Philson entered the staff kitchen with the intention of consuming his private meal (a home-made sandwich cut diagonally and packed in a plastic container) but discovered the refrigerator had <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> his meal. Agent Philson began to kick the Bureau-owned appliance as he expressed his frustration in a loud and profane manner. </p>

<p>This behavior caused multiple staff members present to become alarmed. Security was alerted soon after. Philson complied with security’s commands to desist. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Initial encounters with the entity known as the Hiss have revealed various behavioral facts. Most notably, the Hiss is able to invade or corrupt Control Points, Altered Items, and even humans, radically changing their behavior. Curiously, any person wearing one of the wearable HRA devices that Dr. Darling has been distributing over the past weeks was not affected by this corruption. </p>

<p>The only known exception to this fact is the new Director, Jesse Faden, who possesses an inherent immunity to the Hiss. This could indicate that she has already been corrupted, but her behavior is so in contrast to that of the other Hiss that I have dismissed the theory. </p>

<p>My final observation comes from Ms. Faden herself. She is able to “cleanse” material and organisms of the Hiss corruption. We tested this ability on a Hiss corrupted entity, but unfortunately the process seems to kill the host. Perhaps the host’s physiology becomes reliant on the Hiss? More work to be done. </p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Researchers were sent to transcribe the recursive chant repeated by the Hiss entities. In the interest of safety, this was done with the non-aggressive floating Hiss entities, however no distinction between this repeating phrase and the one repeated by the more violent Hiss entities has been observed. What is the purpose of this repeating string of words? Is this how the Hiss corrupts individuals? Does the chant produce a physical effect? Is it a message? An incantation?</p>

<p>We were able to record a firsthand recitation of the chanting. See the corresponding audio record.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>If we understand the Hiss to be a force based on vibration and resonance, then perhaps their incantation (which is now the agreed upon term for their vocalizations) is an effort to express that resonance using human vocal cords and speech. Would there be differences if the incantation were recited in a different language?</p>

<p>The most common word used is “want”. Interestingly, every usage of the word is attributed to a “you”. “You want to listen”, “you want this to be true”, “you must want these waves to drag you away.” Are we the “you” the Hiss are referring to? Does the Hiss believe humanity, possibly all non-Hiss life, wants to join it? To be consumed by it? Is that its goal? </p>

<p>The second most used words are “through” and “time”. Is this possibly the Hiss stating how they arrived here? Or an indication of its age? </p>

<p>There is clear intention in the words. Dismissing the incantation as “nonsense”, as some of my colleagues recommend, is beyond idiotic. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>--CONFIDENTIAL--</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Hiss corruption manifests in vastly different ways. Some hosts remain largely unchanged, while others are barely recognizable as human. What determines this level of alteration? Is it the duration of corruption? It could simply be an evolutionary process, each entity representing a stage of growth in an undiscovered linear progression leading towards… what?</p>

<p>Additionally, Hiss entities possess various paranatural abilities. How have they achieved this? Do they gain them from corrupting Objects of Power? Have they corrupted a single highly-talented parautilitarian and divided their access to paranatural abilities across the network of Hiss-corrupted hosts?</p>

<p>As a scientist, I am hindered by the sheer number of questions. It’s difficult to identify where one should begin. What is the most pertinent question?</p>

<p>How do we kill it? That seems like a good start.</p>

<p align=CENTER><b>OBJECTS OF POWER AND THEIR ASTRAL CONNECTIONS</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Dr. Darling is insistent that certain Objects of Power share a direct connection to the <em>[REDA]</em>, an entity or group of entities that we have little information on (or little that I am allowed to access). In his written reports, he states that there is a clear link between these Objects of Power, the <em>[REDA]</em>, the Astral Plane, and the Oldest House itself. His work supposes these links are innate, a fact ingrained into the very <em>[REDACTED]</em> of Objects such as the Hotline or the Service Weapon. </p>

But what if these particular Objects were never linked to the <em>[REDA]</em>, but had that connection forced upon them? Isn’t it strange that no other Objects of Power require such direct contact with the <em>[REDA]</em>? Isn’t it strange that using the Service Weapon or the Hotline will result in grievous harm or even death if the user is not the Director or at least worthy of the role? Why do we assume this involvement by the <em>[REDA]</em> is a natural fact and not something more <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>? </p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Collective unconscious is defined as a form of the unconscious that is shared in all human minds. From this arises unconscious knowledge linking us through our ancestral heritage (see Jung report, pg. 12-34). Through this collective unconscious, we unknowingly attribute a series of images and archetypes to all elements of our lives. These archetypes are never fixed, but shift and change in tandem with our species and culture. </p>

<p>This internal belief in the power of images, shared by a massive population, is <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> in the creation of Altered Items and Objects of Power. The sheer amount of <em>[REDACT</em> <em>EDACTED]</em> exuded is attracted to the best representation of that image, imbuing a single object with massive amounts of <em>[REDACTED]</em>. </p>

<p>Theoretically, Places of Power could likewise be formed by the simple power of sustained, collective belief. </p>

<p>1. Ensure the volunteer is securely fastened in their chair. </p>

<p>2. Ensure the hood is placed over the volunteer’s head. This will prevent the volunteer from taking in visual stimuli during the record process, which can lower the quality of captured footage. (This also prevents recording technicians from viewing the volunteer’s face, which undergoes muscle spasms during recording that some consider upsetting). </p>

<p>3. Check if the volunteer is comfortable. </p>

<p>4. Activate the recording apparatus. </p>

<p>5. After recording is complete, check volunteer cognitive ability using the provided questionnaire. </p>

<p>Dear Dr. Darling, </p>

<p>I feel I must inform you of the VERY questionable documentation I am seeing from Underhill’s desk. She clearly has no concept of what the Mold is. She claims there are micro-organisms responsible for constructing the Mold. Ridiculous. It’s a rapidly growing fungus, not dissimilar to kudzu! She’s fabricating complexity to justify her absurd budget demands. </p>

<p>Speaking of which, I find it interesting that an old friend of yours gets her budget approved with no questions asked. I wonder if the operations oversight committee would be interested to learn of that. </p>

<p>Yours in Estimation, </p>

<p>Dr. Abraham Lewis</p>

<p>Have you noticed the recent tension between Trench and Darling? They’ve both been acting odd lately.</p>

<p>Trench concerns me the most. His sudden hostility towards Darling’s project is very unlike him. He was the one to approve all this Hedron research in the first place, but after Darling unveiled those HRAs, he was livid. I personally don’t see any reason not to equip Bureau staff with an additional protective device, especially not if it’s as strong as Darling says. </p>

<p>What do you make of this? Have you seen anything from either of them that strikes you as odd? Let’s talk in person soon, before the next Bureau Heads meeting. </p>

<p>Threshold with effect <em>[REDACTD]</em> manifested in the Containment Sector, in the middle of the <em>[CTED]</em> Department. Simultaneously, numerous <em>[REDAC]</em> appeared in the area, injuring and killing many <em>[REDAC]</em>.

<p>The area was sealed off after removing the clocks proved an impossible task. The department was relocated and the area abandoned. </p>

<p>Researchers theorize the Threshold introduced unstable matter to our dimension, which adopted the form of the <em>[REDACTED</em> <em>REDACT]</em>, as <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> when introduced to more stable <em>[REDACTED]</em>. </p>

<p>Darling here!</p>

<p>Some of you were curious why I had these sensory deprivation tanks installed. I thought I’d shed some light on the subject. </p>

<p>Maybe some of you have heard of a Dr. Yoshimi Tokui, the man behind the hugely popular guided imagery experience tapes. Apparently his tapes go beyond the normal meditative qualities of such things, but create genuine hallucinatory visions in some listeners, or so the reports say. </p>

<p>We brought these tanks in to test Dr. Tokui’s tapes for ourselves. Plus, there may be some stress-relieving uses for the staff down the road. I think we could all benefit from some time in a dark, enclosed space, don’t you? </p>

<p>The Safe Object of Power can produce a barrier using objects or material from its immediate vicinity (see OOP22 case file for more details).

<p>The Slide Projector only works with Slide 36. Logically this means the slide itself is a part of the Object of Power, or a distinct Altered Item. But of course I had to make sure no other slides worked. I had to try. I thought maybe emotion had something to do with it. Connection. History. Love. </p>

<p>I brought in my parents’ old slides. Birthday parties, vacations to Niagara Falls, my first day of high school, that kind of thing. There were two box’s worth. I had to dig around the garage for an hour to find them. Never once thought of looking at them since they passed. </p>

<p>I tried them all. I waited until all the staff left for the night. I stayed up in that booth for hours, trying every one. Projector off, slide out, slide in, Projector on. Nothing happens. Projector off, slide out, slide in, Projector on. Nothing happens. </p>

<p>Love wasn’t the common factor. There’s no correlation that I can see. Maybe the slide itself is the Object of Power. Maybe the Projector’s just an accessory. Maybe it doesn’t matter. </p>

<p>I called up to medical right away. He was half-starved. He’s been missing for two weeks, so I guess it’s not a surprise. While I was waiting for someone to come help, he kept telling me about some carvings. Something about an “ancient tree”. I couldn’t really understand him. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>EXPERIMENTATION WITH GLOBAL SYNCHRONICITY</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>As a test, television sets were placed in a variety of locations around the world inside rooms identically decorated. The hypothesis was that by identically altering the décor of every room, and then changing the channel in every room but one, that the single differing television would spontaneously align the incoming frequency to match its synchronized counterparts.</p>

<p>The experiment seemed like a failure, until it was observed that the agents responsible for arranging and monitoring these rooms were all experiencing the same emotional turmoil as one clinically-depressed member of the team (himself being located in the eastern part of <em>[REDACTED]</em>). Psychological examination of the agents proved the correlation. Interestingly, the phenomenon of Synchronicity did occur, but not in the way we predicted. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>SYNCHRONICITY AND THE UNSEEN CONNECTIONS</b></p>

<p><u>INTRODUCTION:</u></p>

<p>Synchronicity is a phenomena long recognized by the wise, but only recently given a name by science. It is how we rationalize events connected by no identifiable causality, yet clearly conjoined in purpose. How does a dream foretell an event in the physical plane? Why do hounds bale at the death of their master, which has occurred miles away? The world is unified in ways we do not yet understand, and sometimes we stumble across these invisible unseen cords and wonder at the result. </p>

<p>The visionary Carl Jung laid the road, now we must walk it. My fledgling Research Department will make it our mission to reliably reproduce <em>[REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED]</em> behavior by the close of 1959. Once done, the mechanics of synchronicity will lay themselves bare in due time. We are striding into the future of science. History may not remember our names, but God himself will. </p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The Oldest House imposes certain limitations on our Bureau, but by far the most restrictive is the inability to use certain technological instruments. </p>

<p>The Oldest House does not allow devices that receive or emit any <em>[RED]</em> signal. Radio waves are the only transmittable signals in the Oldest House, and even those are often unreliable. </p>

<p>If the power of collective unconscious is taken into account, it could be that certain pieces of technology are too “new” in the cultural <em>[REDACTED]</em> for the Oldest House to <em>[REDACTED]</em> them. Similarly, these items have not been known to become receptacles for altered status. Technology may be moving at too fast a pace for the <em>[REDACTED]</em> to occur. </p>

<p>Modern technology tends to disappear and break here, sometimes quite violently. <em>[REDACT]</em> agents have been injured by cell phones exploding in their pockets while entering the Oldest House. </p>

<p><u>TELEVISION SHOW PROPOSAL</u></p>

<p>Based on the success of America Overnight, we would like to propose the creation of a television series that presents superstition and skeptical thought as entertainment, in order to popularize these concepts among the civilian population and create less resistance to redirecting information regarding public paranatural events. </p>

<p>We can also use a solid media outlet to test paranatural concepts on civilian audiences, seeing how they react to certain facts (presented as fiction) in the event that the Bureau ever decides to make certain realities public knowledge. </p>

<p>There are various show licenses that we could purchase and “reboot” rather than starting from scratch. One particular property seems promising, especially considering its content and tone are precisely what we’re looking for. It’s called “Night Springs” and has been off the air for a few years now. </p>

<p align=CENTER> “So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.”</p>

<p>For years, the Federal Bureau of Control has been wrongfully forcing a philosophy upon itself and its people. This philosophy is known to you all as “science”. </p>

<p>We all realize that the concepts we explore here are mystic ones, with arcane-thinking required to understand them. Yet we insist on using words like “paranatural” and “parautilitarian” to create the illusion of a scientific structure; a tidy little system. The Bureau is desperate to stand with the close-minded cult of logic and data that has overrun our society. If a thing cannot be quantified, then we dismiss it outright. We live in an age that is openly hostile to faith in the veiled forces governing our reality. </p>

<p>I must remain anonymous for fear of reprisal from the anti-esoteric bureaucrats watching us from their plush offices. Those same bureaucrats, Trench and Darling chief among them, have been steering us away from the Bureau’s arcane foundations for decades now. It is time we corrected course. </p>

<p>If you stand with me, share this message. We are not alone. </p>

opcon_doc_thepowerofritual_01_DESCRIPTION1: <p align=CENTER><b>EXAMINATION OF PARANATURAL TOPICS</b></p>

<p align=CENTER><b>TANGIBLE EFFECT OF RITUALS</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY: </u></p>

<p>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, hoarding, anxiety disorders. While certain manifestations of these conditions are simply the result of mental illness, sometimes the individuals are simply performing <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em> called rituals. </p>

<p>The <em>[REDACTED]</em> of rituals can vary. Numerology, dream-logic, forfeiture, verbal formulae, repetitive action, and causal tethering are just some of the procedures involved. Some rituals are consistent, such as pulling the light switch cord three times to enter the Motel, but some are erratic. </p>

<p>While most people engage in minor rituals every day, the vast majority do not understand the importance behind their actions. Avoiding disaster, amassing luck, or simply locating lost keys are all the results of daily rituals. Individuals who recognize a deeper meaning behind these compulsive actions are inherently aware of the paranatural world and, when located, should be considered for employment at the Bureau. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>THRESHOLDS</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>The Oldest House is a place in flux. Thresholds appear with no warning. What the Threshold will contain is a question we can only answer once it manifests. </p>

<p>The widely accepted theory is that Thresholds are dimensions vibrating on a <em>[REDACTED]</em> frequency different from our own. When these frequencies match, the Threshold will manifest in the Oldest House, which acts as a <em>[REDACTED]</em>. Others theorize Thresholds are parallel universes or possibly our own reality at a different point in time. Some believe our collection of altered materials affects the House or attracts the Thresholds. We do know for certain that Thresholds are not permanent. Eventually their frequency will shift. </p>

<p>Some believe Earth itself is just another Threshold connected to the Oldest House, which is actually rooted in some other reality. This theory, while impossible to disprove, causes <em>[REDACTED RED]</em> in those who learn of it so is actively denied. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>THE “THRESHOLD KIDS”</b></p>

<p><u>PROBLEM:</u></p>

<p>With the recent arrival of the <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>, there are certain glaring gaps in the Bureau’s ability to educate and raise a young <em>[RED]</em>. There are no other <em>[REDACTED]</em> for <em>[RED]</em> to play with and <em>[RED]</em> is expected to learn about a frightening new concepts.</p>

<p><u>SOLUTION:</u></p>

<p><em>[REDACTE]</em> will require a slow, <em>[RED]</em>-friendly introduction to paranatural topics. With this in mind, allow me to introduce the Threshold Kids, a television show in which a cast of cheerful puppets explain the dangers of living at the Bureau, but also show the fun side of the paranatural!</p>

<p>Budget would be minimal. I took a few puppet-making courses at my local community center. We can have research staff build the sets, record the footage, and even do the voices. It will be good for morale, and I guarantee <em>[REDACTED]</em> will respond positively to these videos. We can’t expect a <em>[REDACT]</em> to enjoy lectures and people in lab coats. But, as television has proven for years, <em>[REDA]</em> love puppets!</p>

<p>I also wanted to ask how your coffee with Emily went. She’s a star on the rise, incredibly bright, extremely intuitive. But I want to hear what you thought of her. I think you two could be very good on a project together, could learn a lot from each other. Let’s get together and chat about it soon. </p>

<p align=CENTER><b>RE: THRESHOLDS UTILITY RESEARCH</b></p>

<p><u>SUMMARY:</u></p>

<p>Dr. Darling’s recently-penned essay titled <em>[REDACTED REDAED</em> <em>EDACTED]</em> contains some glaring omissions that I feel I must shine a light on. </p>

<p>Firstly, the entire premise of the essay is that the Quarry Threshold is beneficial to the Bureau, while the Mold is “actively hostile”, to use his words. We cannot determine the worth of these dimensions and their lifeforms using bureaucratic definitions. </p>

<p>Secondly, the Mold is much more beneficial than some rock. If the <em>[REDACTED]</em> creating the Mold were reconfigured in their purpose, the structures they could build would rival the greatest skyscrapers. The Mold’s resistance to various strains of disease we’ve attempted to introduce could be derived into <em>[REDACTED REDACTED]</em>. </p>

<p>Yes, admittedly, this application is more difficult than picking up a rock and gluing it to a wall, but I pause to wonder when the Bureau lost its eagerness for a challenge. </p>

<p>Start with the following: </p>

<p> “Welcome to the Federal Bureau of Control, established in 1964 as part of an effort to strengthen government relations. We are proud to serve the United States and her people as we strive for transparency and excellence in all aspects of our esteemed nation’s infrastructure.” </p>

<p>If they do not leave, then ask them these questions: </p>

<p>1. Are you here to see someone? </p>

<p>2. Are you from New York City or just visiting? </p>

<p>3. How’d you find this place? </p>

<p>If their answers are sufficiently harmless, explain that this is a secure federal office and that they’ll need to leave. </p>

<p>If their answers seem <em>[REDACTED]</em>, escort them to a private room. There, perform the Gunnars Psychological Assessment. If their responses are within the acceptable range of deviance (see the provided scoring sheet) then <em>REDACTED REDAC</em> immediately. </p>

OPCON_DYLAN_02_DYLAN_771: Casper said she could come too, to the Bureau, 
OPCON_DYLAN_02_DYLAN_773: Because she didn’t care about me. 
OPCON_DYLAN_02_DYLAN_775: Why?
OPCON_DYLAN_02_DYLAN_777: I don’t remember.
OPCON_DYLAN_02_DYLAN_779: I’m done with this. 
OPCON_DYLAN_02_DYLAN_8060: When I was little, I mean. 
OPCON_DYLAN_02_DYLAN_8061: Back in Ordinary.

OPCON_DYLAN_02_DYLAN_8065: We went everywhere together,

OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8075: We loved it. 
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8076: we found a way in, deeper into it, like it had shifted. 
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8077: We went inside, and that’s where we found the Slide Projector. 
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8078: I remember... 
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8081: No... yes, but that has nothing to do-
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8089: Come on. 
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8090: That has nothing to do with this. 
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8091: Nothing. 
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8092: The Slide Projector-
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8097: I don’t think so, I don’t remember. 
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8098: Maybe. 
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8099: I don’t know.
OPCON_JESSE_01_JESSE_8100: was different... 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST: 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_3285: A dump is a place for lost things. 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_3287: Was there a slide projector at your home, when you were small? 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_3289: Those were before your time, I suppose. 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_3291: Hmmm... when was this, can you remember? 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_3293: Let me ask you this: 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8079: Things that have been thrown away. 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8080: Did you ever feel that way when you were growing up, Jesse?
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8082: But your family did look at photos together maybe, 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8083: At parties, barbecues? 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8084: How did it make you feel? 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8085: Did your parents ever show pictures that embarrassed you? 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8086: Was alcohol ever involved at these parties?
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8087: Did your parents drink? 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8088: Did that make you uncomfortable?
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8093: As a child, did you ever fantasize about worlds inside pictures.
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8094: Inside a painting? 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8095: You know, stepping into a painting, into a hidden world, escaping, 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8096: Away from your parents?
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8559: and finding adventures there? 
OPCON_JESSE_01_PSYCHIATRIST_8560: in one form or the other? 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE: 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3296: Yes.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3298: What? 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3300: I didn’t...
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3302: Okay. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3304: No.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3305: No...
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3306: Dylan’s not dead.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3307: And... 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3309: Polaris... 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3311: It felt more real than anything. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3314: No, it wasn’t an accident. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_3316: No.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8102: “Beyond the shadow you settle for, there’s a miracle illuminated.”
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8106: I don’t...
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8111: Yeah.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8112: It’s this...
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8113: I feel... 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8114: an emptiness, a yearning for something that I think I lost.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8116: that’s not even it.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8118: she’s come back, after a long time.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8119: She’s calling me...
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8120: in a dream I saw. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8121: She showed me things.  
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8122: As real as what happened in Ordinary.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8124: There was no “industrial accident.” 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8125: And Polaris didn’t cause it. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8126: She saved me and Dylan.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8127: The government knows about it.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8128: Agents from... I don’t know exactly. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8129:  It was a cover up. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8130: There were agents there.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8132: They took Dylan. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8133:  They... I’ll find them. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8134: I won’t stop looking. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8135: Polaris wants me to go to New York. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8136: There’s a... building there.
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8137: I have to leave soon. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8138: I have to be there at a very specific time. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8139: Something... 
OPCON_JESSE_02_JESSE_8140: something hugely important is going to happen-
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST: 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_3295: You mentioned a poem last time we talked... 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_3297: Hmm... 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_3299: No matter. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_3301: No matter. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_3303: It is natural for you to feel that way. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_3308: You are referring to the imaginary friend from your childhood.
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_3310: Jesse.
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_3312: The industrial accident in your home town? 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_3313: ...that you believe “Polaris” caused?
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_3315: Jesse.
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_3317: Jesse, you know we can’t let you go until you’re well. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8101: by Thomas Zane.
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8103: I looked the poem up... 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8104: only I could not find any poet by that name.
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8105: I did find a European filmmaker who moved here in the sixties, 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8107: It suits you very well, the poem. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8108: How you see things. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8109: Maybe you wrote it yourself?
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8110: Can we talk about that?
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8115: Your brother and your parents are dead.
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8141: And that begins by understanding what’s real and what’s imagined. 
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8561: named Thomas Zane.
OPCON_JESSE_02_PSYCHIATRIST_8562: You’ve said a few times that you feel like “there’s a piece of you missing.”

OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MEG: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MEG_793: I did bad on my clairvoyance test.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MEG_796: E...S...P?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MEG_803: What if I don’t want the big chair?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_792: I can see you’re upset, Meg. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_794: You can’t ace every test, Meg. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_795: Some brains can talk to each other.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_797: No interruptions!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_798: Some brains can lift objects, like a baseball. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_799: Talk about a “fly ball”, eh, Meg?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_800: No interruptions!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_801: So who cares if you fail your clairvoyance test?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_802: Once we know what your brains can do,
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_804: What if I don’t want the big chair.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_805: Everyone wants the big chair, Meg! 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_8301: Why don’t you tell uncle Mr. Bones what’s wrong.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_8302: You see, everyone has different brains.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_8303: We call this ESP.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_8304: Maybe your brain can throw baseballs, 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_8305: And if your brains are just right, 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_8306: That’s why we’re all here! 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_8307: Use those brains to listen for once 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_8563: or talk to dead people, or make friends blind!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_8564: we’ll know what job to give you. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_8565: you'll get to sit in the BIG chair. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_8566: or the only chair you’ll get in is the one with straps!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_01_MR._BONES_O.S.: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_8308: we can stabilize the Oldest House. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_8309: Safe employees... 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_8310: But accidents do happen...
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_8311: I heard you got stuck in your room for three days, Topher. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_8312: Too bad you didn’t have your book with you!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_8314: When you feel the floor deviate,
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_840: Fixed!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_841: Building shifts occur at random and without warning, 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_842: Are happy employees!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_843: Certain rituals allow agents to navigate the Oldest House as well. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_844: Trapping agents inside the walls. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_845: Or any food!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_846: And remember, kids: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_8567: but with the Bureau’s cutting-edge technology, 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_8568: it's already much too late.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_MR._BONES_O.S.: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_TOPHER: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_TOPHER_839: No no no no no NO NO!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_04_TOPHER_8662: (carefree humming)
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_MEG: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_MEG_8316: They blacked it out.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_MEG_8318: A dirty, rotten fart person.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_MEG_8320: We’ll find your momma together.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_MEG_848: My mom’s dead.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_MEG_851: I don’t know! 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_MEG_853: Then the Director’s a poophead! 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_MEG_856: I’ll help you look, Topher. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_TOPHER: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_TOPHER_8315: What’s wrong?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_TOPHER_8317: “Confidential” and “Children” both start with “C”.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_TOPHER_8319: She walked into the City and didn’t come back.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_TOPHER_847: Hey, Meg.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_TOPHER_849: I’m so sorry, Meg.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_TOPHER_850: What happened?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_TOPHER_852: It’s like the Director says: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_TOPHER_854: Dad says that my momma went missing in actions. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_TOPHER_855: I don’t know what missing in actions is, 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_05_TOPHER_8569: but I sure wish someone would find her.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_8323: It’s in the Astral Plane.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_8324: It’s big, white, and empty.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_8326: It’s a weird crazy alien dimension.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_8327: You can get lost in all that white...
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_858: It’s-
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_860: I’m drawing the Pyramid.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_862: The Pyramid.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_864: The Black Pyramid. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_866: Astral Plane! 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_867: Or is it? 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_869: The white goes on forever. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_MEG_870: and never find your way back home.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_TOPHER: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_TOPHER_8321: What are you drawing?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_TOPHER_857: Hey Meg! 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_TOPHER_859: I’m drawing a dog!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_TOPHER_861: The what?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_TOPHER_863: What’s a peer-a-men?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_TOPHER_865: Airplane?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_06_TOPHER_871: I miss my home.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MEG: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MEG_7062: Aren’t ready for the truth of reality.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MEG_7063: Not secret.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MEG_7064: Secret.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MEG_8341: Not secret.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MEG_897: Secret.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MEG_901: I’m not allowed to go outside anymore.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8328: I think it’s a good time to talk about secrets. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8329: Who can tell me what a secret is?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8330: A secret is something you don’t tell anyone outside the Bureau. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8331: Because people outside the Bureau...
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8332: When you tell someone a secret,
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8333: Let’s review what exactly is or isn't a secret. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8334: Secret or not secret?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8335: And the true version of rainbows?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8336: Cats?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8337: And the Alpine Chimera?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8338: Too many slip ups,
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8339: You don’t want to end up like Meg, do you?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8570: into the world outside our wonderful Bureau,
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8572: you’re hurting their brains very badly.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_8573: and your father will have to go on vacation without you.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_884: Since little Topher is taking a trip with his father 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_886: Partially correct, Topher. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_888: Very good. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_889: Now! 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_890: First, we have a rainbow. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_892: Correct. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_894: Correct. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_896: Correct. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_899: Ah ah, Topher. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_MR._BONES_902: Correct!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_TOPHER: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_TOPHER_8340: What happened to Meg?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_TOPHER_8571: so they don’t get scared.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_TOPHER_885: It’s something you hide from everyone
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_TOPHER_887: Aren’t ready for the truth of reality.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_TOPHER_891: Not secret.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_TOPHER_893: Secret.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_TOPHER_895: Not secret.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_TOPHER_898: Not secret.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_08_TOPHER_900: What? 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_MEG: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_MEG_8342: Always be suspicious of things that weren’t there before.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_MEG_8343: It’s not even plugged in-
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_MEG_926: It’s not safe.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_MEG_929: Okay.
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_MEG_930: Bureau rule number 74: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_MEG_931: Looks safe to me!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_MEG_933: Wait. 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_TOPHER: 
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_TOPHER_925: TV! Let’s watch “Donkeys in Space”!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_TOPHER_927: But Star Captain Hee Haw!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_TOPHER_928: Can I poke it with a stick?
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_TOPHER_932: “Donkeys in Spaaaaace”!
OPCON_THRESKIDS_10_TOPHER_934: Captain Hee Haw, why?

OPCONV_DF_01_DYLAN_681: I’d like to tell you about a dream I had last night.
OPCONV_DF_01_DYLAN_684: [0.14-4.20]I was back in Ordinary before all of this happened.[6.03-12.58]But in the dream, I was alone, it was just me.[13.56-15.17]I was the only child.[16.30-17.29]A girl.[18.38-22.85]My name was Jesse Dylan Faden.[24.86-28.76]But then the Bureau came and caught me, brought me back here.[29.63-30.63]Locked me up.
OPCONV_DF_01_DYLAN_685: [0.17-5.55]Have you ever noticed that our names - Jesse, Dylan[6.00-11.43]they could be girls’ names, boys’ names, could be anything.[12.88-14.65]Don’t you find that weird?[16.18-17.61]I find that weird.
OPCONV_DF_01_JESSE_678: I don’t know what else I’m hoping to find here.
OPCONV_DF_01_JESSE_679: Dylan? 
OPCONV_DF_01_JESSE_680: Can we talk?
OPCONV_DF_01_JESSE_682: Off to a good start.
OPCONV_DF_01_JESSE_683: [0.17-0.70]Okay.[0.70-2.80]I’m listening.
OPCONV_DF_01_JESSE_686: Sure.
OPCONV_DF_01_JESSE_687: [0.12-1.55]What the hell was that?[2.08-3.29]Is he trying to mess with me?
OPCONV_DF_02_DYLAN_693: Dylan would like to tell you about a dream he had just now.
OPCONV_DF_02_DYLAN_695: [0.28-3.38]I was going to be the new director of this place.[4.97-9.02]I helped you get a job here, so we could be together.[10.15-11.91]You were an office assistant.[12.86-18.47]You’d make coffee and deliver the mail and there was always plenty of work to do.[19.95-24.43]And it stayed that way forever and ever.[25.80-26.91]It was nice.[28.27-29.67]Really nice.
OPCONV_DF_02_DYLAN_697: [0.12-7.88]But here’s the strange thing, the dream shifted, and none of it was real anymore.[8.63-9.67]It was a game.[10.78-20.22]We were in a game, and it was a fucking boring game, but you couldn’t stop playing.
OPCONV_DF_02_DYLAN_698: [0.13-6.26]And then it shifted again, or maybe it was another dream already,[6.29-9.02]or maybe I’m just confusing them.[10.30-14.54]But in this other dream it was more like a musical.
OPCONV_DF_02_DYLAN_699: [0.46-8.03]This is an ordinary song, about an ordinary girl, from an ordinary town.[8.59-10.86]It's the ordinary story...[12.53-17.65]She worked an ordinary job, in an ordinary office.[18.33-17.65].[18.33-17.65].[18.33-20.31]something, something, something.
OPCONV_DF_02_DYLAN_700: And that’s all I can remember of that dream.
OPCONV_DF_02_JESSE_690: [0.11-1.47]Maybe Dylan’s still in there.[2.03-3.54]Maybe there’s a way to reach him.
OPCONV_DF_02_JESSE_691: I’d like to talk to my brother, please. 
OPCONV_DF_02_JESSE_692: Dylan?
OPCONV_DF_02_JESSE_694: This again?
OPCONV_DF_02_JESSE_696: That’s debatable.
OPCONV_DF_02_JESSE_701: Maybe that’s for the best.
OPCONV_DF_03_DYLAN_706: I just had an interesting dream.
OPCONV_DF_03_DYLAN_709: This dream was about the Hiss.
OPCONV_DF_03_DYLAN_711: [0.08-6.86]In my dream, the Hiss had broken free of this prison, this house.[8.64-10.90]I’d set it free.[11.61-14.83]And the president himself was there to welcome us.[15.55-21.48]He was the first to take the Hiss in, to spread the word.
OPCONV_DF_03_DYLAN_712: [0.25-7.90]At first, many people thought it was horrifying, that he was horrifying.[9.15-15.94]But also many people who heard his words wanted to welcome the Hiss in.[16.96-26.46]And slowly more and more of them came around, until the whole world was brought together by the Hiss.[28.74-30.59]It was wonderful.
OPCONV_DF_03_JESSE_704: Maybe I can learn more about the Hiss from him.
OPCONV_DF_03_JESSE_705: Can we talk?
OPCONV_DF_03_JESSE_707: Shit.
OPCONV_DF_03_JESSE_708: That’s fascinating, but let’s talk about the Hiss for a change, yeah?
OPCONV_DF_03_JESSE_710: [0.09-0.51]Eh...[1.57-2.64]best I’m gonna get.
OPCONV_DF_03_JESSE_713: [0.08-0.65]Okay.[1.26-2.50]Thanks for sharing that.
OPCONV_DF_03_JESSE_714: [0.12-2.16]For the record: that will never happen.[2.78-4.02]Not as long as I'm alive.
OPCONV_DF_04_DYLAN_719: I’m glad you asked, sister.
OPCONV_DF_04_DYLAN_720: [0.03-6.42]This dream, like all dreams now, felt very real.[7.53-12.83]Like reality, and reality now feels like a dream.[14.44-15.93]Maybe it’s all a dream.[17.84-19.39]Maybe it’s all real.
OPCONV_DF_04_DYLAN_722: [0.20-5.34]I was in a dark place, and there was a dark man there.[6.34-8.]His name was Mr. Door.[9.61-17.33]And he told me that there are many worlds, side by side, on top of each other, [17.35-19.28]some inside of others.[20.53-25.05]In one world, there’s a writer who wrote a story about a cop.[26.36-29.89]In another world, the cop was real.
OPCONV_DF_04_DYLAN_724: [0.46-6.92]Door said he himself was in all of them at the same time, endlessly shifting between them.[8.07-10.49]I asked him how I could reach these worlds.[11.60-14.00]I wanted to bring the Hiss there.[16.83-18.39]But he didn’t want to help me.[19.47-22.44]He didn't like the idea.[24.06-25.33]What did he know?
OPCONV_DF_04_JESSE_717: Maybe I’m here just to punish myself.
OPCONV_DF_04_JESSE_718: Any new dreams you’d like to share, Dylan?
OPCONV_DF_04_JESSE_721: A dream where my brother endlessly tells me about his dreams.
OPCONV_DF_04_JESSE_725: Not wild about the idea myself.
OPCONV_DF_05_DYLAN_758: [0.12-0.48]Yes.[1.29-2.05]Yes.[2.95-5.58]In fact, I’m having a dream right now.
OPCONV_DF_05_DYLAN_760: [0.13-6.87]In this dream, I’m standing in the corner, watching Jesse and Dylan talk about this very dream.[7.86-10.86]“This very dream”, he said just now.[11.84-13.43]And repeated it again now.[14.85-18.08]I’m standing there and watching, and that’s all I can do...[19.02-21.04]it’s as if I’m trapped there.
OPCONV_DF_05_DYLAN_761: And that’s all I have to say about that dream.
OPCONV_DF_05_JESSE_756: [0.35-1.49]Here we go again.[2.00-3.52]Once more with feeling.
OPCONV_DF_05_JESSE_757: [0.03-1.08]Let me guess.[1.30-3.05]You want to tell me about your dream.
OPCONV_DF_05_JESSE_759: Oh, that’s new.
OPCONV_DF_05_JESSE_762: [0.19-0.72]Okay.[0.72-2.13]Okay, Dylan.[3.53-4.19]That’s good.
OPCONV_DF_05_JESSE_763: [0.15-1.74]Is he still in there?[2.47-4.89]Or is this the Hiss playing mind games?[6.60-7.97]I don’t know.
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1843: This place has a bad habit of moving around, huh?
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1845: So they’re dangerous?
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1847: How do people work here?
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1848: [0.17-3.50]Can you tell me what an Object of Power is exactly?[4.36-5.10]This is all...[6.16-7.69]well, new to me.
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1850: Did she memorize this?
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1851: [0.60-1.12]Got it.[2.11-2.54]Thanks.
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1852: What can you tell me about Control Points?
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1854: [0.13-0.92]Right.[2.47-6.44]And, uh, has anyone ever used them to teleport around?
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1856: Because that’s how they work for me.
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1858: Let’s hold off on the tests until later, okay?
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1865: So HRAs stop you from becoming Hiss?
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1867: Doesn’t the timing seem suspicious?
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_1869: [0.34-1.12]Thanks, Emily.[1.92-3.38]I’m sure I’ll have more questions soon.
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_2091: Where did the Hiss come from?
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_2093: No, no, just inside.
OPCONV_EP_01_JESSE_2096: With you on that, Emily.
OPCONV_EP_01_OPTION1: Building Shifts
OPCONV_EP_01_OPTION2: Objects of Power
OPCONV_EP_01_OPTION3: Control Points
OPCONV_EP_01_OPTION4: Tommasi
OPCONV_EP_01_OPTION5: Hedron Resonance Amplifiers
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_1844: [0.16-1.77]So you noticed the Building Shifts.[2.27-7.02]Did you know that 39 percent of Bureau accidents are caused by the Shifts?[7.56-8.35]It’s true.[8.64-10.04]I ran the numbers myself.
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_1846: [0.14-1.28]Oh, very.[1.71-7.53]One time a shark got shifted into a meeting room, along with over 2000 gallons of water.[8.04-12.08]It was a tiger shark, Darling’s pet research project.[12.79-14.58]I forget what he was researching.
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_1849: [0.50-2.63]Don’t worry, I love going over the basics.[3.16-7.30]Objects of Power are mundane objects that house paranatural energies [7.30-12.96]and have developed a link to the Astral Plane and can thus be controlled, which is what differentiates them from Altered Items,[12.96-18.89]which are still housings of paranatural forces but are more volatile and cannot be bound in the parautilitarian sense.[19.65-20.05]Got it?
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_1853: [0.30-3.19]They’re nexus points of the Oldest House’s unique energies.[3.67-8.50]I wrote a 30 page proposal hypothesizing that we could siphon energy directly from them.[9.16-11.78]Darling didn’t even get through the first page before he turned it down.
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_1855: [0.26-0.61]What?[0.72-1.27]No.[1.92-3.34]You mean physically?[4.07-5.80]No, not that I’ve ever heard of.[6.37-6.92]Why?
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_1857: [0.36-0.98]What?[1.01-1.69]Really?[2.52-3.40]Oh my god![3.82-4.82]More tests!
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_1859: [0.34-0.76]Okay.[1.02-5.71]It’s just, wow, this blows my Control Point theories right out of the water.[6.24-6.93]I love it.
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_1866: [0.41-1.66]It seems that way.[2.19-6.88]I hadn’t even heard of an HRA until a few weeks ago, when Dr. Darling started handing them out.[7.54-9.59]I began analyzing mine as soon as I got it.[9.86-15.54]Each one seems to emit a powerful short-range frequency, way beyond anything I’ve ever seen.
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_1868: [0.64-1.78]I thought that too.[2.45-7.11]Dr. Darling usually likes to unveil his latest breakthrough in big presentations.[7.39-9.85]With these, he just passed them out.[10.10-14.14]His behavior makes me wonder what exactly he knew.
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_1870: Just let me know.
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_2092: [0.61-1.33]I’m not sure.[1.65-3.40]You said the Hiss was here when you entered.[3.70-6.15]Did you see anything like that outside, before you came in?
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_2094: [0.28-2.04]The source is internal then.[2.78-5.57]The Oldest House is a sprawling complex, with...[6.03-8.51]openings to other places as well.[9.08-10.50]I don’t even know where to start looking.
OPCONV_EP_01_POPE_2095: [0.43-2.24]But in the context it’s good news.[2.24-3.34]The lockdown holds.[3.75-5.85]The Hiss escaping the building would be the end.[5.96-10.55]A pretty shitty world out there if you ask me, but I wouldn’t want the Hiss to destroy it.
OPCONV_EP_02_JESSE_1871: [0.13-3.15]I keep finding traces of Darling, but still can’t find him.[4.51-5.32]Where could he be?
OPCONV_EP_02_JESSE_1873: Sounds like I touched a nerve.
OPCONV_EP_02_JESSE_1874: He didn’t let you into his labs?
OPCONV_EP_02_JESSE_1876: [0.25-2.85]I wanted to talk to you about the crazy things I can do.[3.77-4.69]My abilities.[5.74-7.84]I get the sense that they’re not very...[8.80-10.22]usual around here.
OPCONV_EP_02_JESSE_1878: [0.46-1.73]An outlier.[2.81-4.04]I like the sound of that.
OPCONV_EP_02_JESSE_1880: What exactly is the Oceanview Motel?
OPCONV_EP_02_JESSE_1882: Does Darling agree with that?
OPCONV_EP_02_JESSE_1884: See you soon.
OPCONV_EP_02_OPTION1: Darling's Whereabouts
OPCONV_EP_02_OPTION2: Jesse
OPCONV_EP_02_OPTION3: Oceanview Motel and Casino
OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_1872: [0.25-3.19]He’s usually in his office in Research, or one of his labs.[3.33-5.52]Dr. Darling has quite a few, all around the Bureau.[6.17-7.66]Could be hiding in any one of them.[8.04-12.11]I’d check myself, but I don’t have access to most of them.
OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_1875: [0.37-1.41]Not all of them, no.[1.71-3.82]Some had “volatile material”.[4.27-4.81]Ridiculous.[4.84-6.96]I mean, this whole place is volatile material![7.41-9.25]Could've at least thought up a more convincing lie.[9.61-12.48]How can I work without access to all the data possible?
OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_1877: [0.94-4.45]“Usual” and “unusual” aren’t really benchmarks at the Bureau.[4.45-13.13]But for some perspective, Director Northmoor once used the Floppy Disk to send a bowling ball six yards through the air and that was considered a huge deal.[13.63-17.08]So, compared to that, you are most certainly an outlier.
OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_1881: [0.16-2.78]That’s a bigger question than you might think.[3.15-7.16]You see, I have extreme doubts that the Motel is a single place.[7.46-9.03]Look at all the doors inside it.[9.24-10.37]Where do they all go?[10.85-13.21]We know that one door leads to the Oldest House,[13.22-16.29]but how come we can only ever open that one door?[16.68-19.34]Maybe to open a door, you have to have entered through it.[19.90-24.69]So if every door leads to a different dimension, plane, reality, whatever you want to call it, [24.70-29.37]then I believe that the Motel is firm proof that parallel universes exist.
OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_1883: [0.15-1.24]I haven’t told him yet.[1.60-3.02]I’m waiting until I can prove it.
OPCONV_EP_02_POPE_1885: Be careful out there.
OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_1886: [0.22-1.58]I visited the Quarry.[2.35-4.53]What’s the plan for all that Black Rock?
OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_1888: Knives?
OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_1891: [0.18-0.69]Wow.[1.08-2.53]I did not expect that from her.
OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_1897: [0.03-1.80]This place is looking good.[2.64-4.73]Arish is making real progress around here.
OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_1899: So you can’t reverse it?
OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_1901: I wonder how often the phrase “mad scientist” is used around here.
OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_1902: How is HRA production coming along?
OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_1904: You deserve thanks too, of course.
OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_1905: We got this place up and running together, Emily.
OPCONV_EP_03_JESSE_1906: [0.21-0.92]I should be going.[1.78-2.55]Enjoy your data.
OPCONV_EP_03_OPTION1: Black Rock
OPCONV_EP_03_OPTION2: Marshall
OPCONV_EP_03_OPTION3: Arish
OPCONV_EP_03_OPTION4: Status of HRA Production
OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_1887: [0.17-4.62]The Bureau has used Black Rock almost exclusively for containment purposes.[5.30-7.05]I say branch out![7.25-8.73]Instead of boxes, helmets![8.76-10.63]Instead of blast shields, knives!
OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_1889: [0.00-0.42]Yes.[0.52-1.22]Knives.[1.22-2.71]So many combat applications![3.02-4.96]Slicing, stabbing, gouging!
OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_1890: [1.17-1.64]Sorry.[2.59-5.13]I’ve been trying to get Darling to explore combat applications for years.[5.13-7.07]Got a little excited.
OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_1898: [0.40-0.82]Right?[1.17-2.91]This place is a fortress.[3.08-7.46]With him taking care of operations here, I can spend more time analyzing the Hiss.[8.05-14.11]I’ve been attempting to isolate and neutralize the Hiss resonance in blood samples, but no luck so far.
OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_1900: [0.89-1.72]Not yet.[1.83-4.28]But perhaps reversing it is too simple.[4.62-10.47]See, if Hiss resonance can rewrite human genetics, then perhaps it’s a question of rewriting the Hiss resonance.[10.87-15.21]In theory, that could pave the way for custom human genetic alteration.
OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_1903: [0.38-1.73]Better than expected.[2.24-4.95]We’ve already made enough to get people out of a couple safe rooms.[5.37-8.01]They’re here, alive, thanks to you.[8.61-11.93]We never would’ve lasted this long if you hadn’t walked in those doors.
OPCONV_EP_03_POPE_1907: Oh, I will.
OPCONV_EP_04_JESSE_1908: [0.30-2.77]I’ve been seeing these Darling presentations all over.[3.52-5.55]Seems like he enjoys the limelight.
OPCONV_EP_04_JESSE_1910: Darling visited you in college?
OPCONV_EP_04_JESSE_1912: [0.15-2.31]I wonder who else Darling hid his work from.[3.76-4.36]Marshall?[6.02-6.80]Trench?
OPCONV_EP_04_JESSE_1913: Have you learned anything about Dylan’s condition?
OPCONV_EP_04_JESSE_1915: [0.69-2.10]I don’t care about the words.[2.99-3.98]What about my brother?
OPCONV_EP_04_JESSE_1917: [0.57-1.71]That’s good news.[2.78-3.32]Right?
OPCONV_EP_04_JESSE_1918: I should get going.
OPCONV_EP_04_OPTION1: Working with Darling
OPCONV_EP_04_OPTION2: Studying Dylan
OPCONV_EP_04_POPE_1909: [0.42-1.53]So you noticed, huh?[1.91-4.93]When he recruited me out of college, he actually came to visit.[4.97-8.95]He interrupted my physics course by shouting “Not quite, professor!"[9.06-15.32]and then marching down to the front of the class where he proceeded to berate the very idea of “laws” of thermodynamics.[15.88-18.29]He’s been a showboat all his life.
OPCONV_EP_04_POPE_1911: [0.15-0.62]Yeah.[0.62-2.45]He read a paper I’d published.[2.63-4.13]Came to recruit me for the Bureau.[4.68-11.62]I accepted and then spent years waiting for access to the confidential research that Darling promised me.[12.12-20.66]Whenever I ask about my access level, he just mumbles that it’s temporarily postponed and then changes the subject to the effect of entropy on luck.
OPCONV_EP_04_POPE_1914: [0.09-4.99]Only that he’s definitely Hiss, but I guess his chanting made that pretty obvious.[5.84-10.64]Interestingly, the words of the Hiss incantation have an average length of four letters.[10.86-13.91]The most common word, used seven times, is “want”.[14.31-17.08]The next most common are “through” and “time”.[17.61-19.47]Very interesting, don’t you think?
OPCONV_EP_04_POPE_1916: [0.38-1.75]Right, sorry.[1.84-3.14]I got a little off track.[4.06-8.25]Strangely, his tissue samples all look healthy, unlike the other Hiss I’ve tested.
OPCONV_EP_04_POPE_1919: Don’t let me hold you up.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1924: [0.25-2.59]I don’t think we’re ever going to understand all of this.[3.28-4.35]And I’m okay with that.[5.36-7.34]I’m just glad you’re here with me.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1925: [0.17-1.11]That’s good to know.[2.24-3.27]Thanks, Emily.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1926: How do you feel about me taking over as Director?
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1929: [0.75-2.68]They’re the Bureau’s past, Emily.[3.62-5.18]We won’t operate like they did.[5.71-7.23]We’ll learn from their mistakes.[8.06-10.07]We’ll be better than they ever were.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1930: We won’t ever be like them.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1931: [0.20-4.58]When the Hiss got into my head, I saw some weird things.[5.63-7.46]I think Darling even spoke to me?[8.81-10.45]Does that make any sense to you?
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1933: And that doesn’t upset you?
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1936: Maybe Darling was just trying to protect you from the darker side of his work.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1938: Which it all was.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1940: How is Dylan?
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1942: [0.24-2.14]Then I just have to wait for him.[3.66-4.30]That’s fair.[5.64-7.92]He waited a long time for me.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1944: [1.28-1.82]I hear you.[3.01-5.62]My brother isn’t exactly popular around here.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1945: I hope one day he’ll have the chance to change that.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1946: [0.35-6.11]So there was a moment after Hedron died that I couldn’t feel my powers.[7.67-11.82]The Hiss got into my head, just for a moment.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1951: Me.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1954: [0.20-3.90]I found Dylan attacking the Astral Plane and the Board.[5.05-6.59]What was he hoping to accomplish?
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1956: That still doesn’t tell us why.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1958: [0.14-1.78]Well, I’ve got a Bureau to run.[2.29-2.99]See you soon.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_1960: [0.93-2.07]Please, Emily.[2.59-3.70]Not even as a joke.
OPCONV_EP_05_JESSE_2110: Then maybe it’s time someone looked into that.
OPCONV_EP_05_OPTION1: Hedron

OPCONV_EP_05_OPTION5: HRA Failure
OPCONV_EP_05_OPTION6: The Board
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1923: [0.00-4.95]Hedron is dead, assuming that word even applies to a resonant-based life form, [4.98-10.56]but whatever it awakened in you, the power you call “Polaris”, is still active.[10.57-13.42]At least that’s what my instruments are telling me.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1927: [0.40-1.85]You act like it just happened.[2.20-4.41]You’ve been Director since we first met, remember?[4.80-5.87]I’m still thrilled.[5.90-7.74]Nothing’s changed, not for me.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1928: [0.14-1.88]But the Bureau has changed.[2.04-3.71]Trench and Darling are gone.[4.13-7.73]Their knowledge, anything not written down, disappeared with them.[8.47-10.19]They knew the Bureau better than anyone.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1932: [1.86-3.92]Empirically, no.[4.08-9.63]But, phantom voices as well as hallucinatory states are not uncommon here.[9.97-13.45]Considering the forces that Dr. Darling was working with,[13.47-16.51]he could have been transferred to a different plane of consciousness, [16.53-18.14]physically or otherwise.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1934: [0.35-1.38]Oh, very![1.68-3.86]The fact that he hid those forces from me?[4.22-5.38]It’s infuriating.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1935: [0.13-3.49]But Darling’s dream was always to look beyond our reality.[3.70-6.10]This time he may have taken a step too far, [6.33-10.90]but as long as his consciousness can perceive his surroundings, I’m sure he’s loving it.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1937: [1.10-1.85]Fuck that![1.85-3.08]I’m not a child.[3.28-5.87]Don’t just assume I’m going to consider something morally repugnant.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1939: Which it all was, of course.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1941: [1.12-1.70]The same.[1.93-6.53]I can’t detect any Hiss activity, but his physiology has certainly been altered by it.[7.07-12.76]I can’t tell if his brain activity is genuine or simply the aftermath of the Hiss, like spasms.[13.42-15.71]Dylan could wake up tomorrow for all I know.[16.28-17.74]I really can’t say.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1943: [0.29-1.18]Don’t worry.[1.32-3.15]We’ll be monitoring him around the clock.[3.95-5.45]If he wakes up, we’ll be ready.[6.55-11.71]I don’t mean that in a hostile way, just, well, you know.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1947: [1.29-3.47]That explains the HRA outage.[4.78-8.52]Before we knew what was happening, the Hiss had us.[9.53-10.90]They were in my head.[10.90-11.48]I saw...[12.70-13.97]terrible things.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1949: Dylan vanished afterwards and we fought off the Hiss that came after him.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1950: So if Hedron’s death knocked out the HRAs, that means there must be a new local source for them to relay which I’m guessing must be-
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1952: You.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1955: [0.67-1.11]Huh.[2.07-5.60]Since they arrived, Hiss have been corrupting Objects of Power,[5.70-7.98]which have an inherent link to the Astral Plane.[8.64-13.36]Maybe their goal was to access the Astral Plane, and the Board itself.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1957: [0.26-2.54]Hiss motives are a difficult thing to work out.[2.74-8.26]But I have been digging through confidential files and noticed a strange gap in knowledge regarding the Board.[8.74-13.27]Looks like any data on them has either been deleted or was never gathered in the first place.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_1959: Yes, ma’am, Director Faden.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_2111: Maybe it is.
OPCONV_EP_05_POPE_3430: [0.60-3.76]I was about to go under forever when the Hiss was pushed back.[3.76-5.24]The HRAs had come back on.
OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_1832: The Hotline should be in the Communications department.
OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_1833: I don’t know how you managed to get into Maintenance, but hurry and get the lockdown lifted so we can go find the others.
OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_1834: [0.20-2.72]I’ve looked through the docs we found in Dimensional Research.[3.05-7.12]That Slide Projector is extremely powerful.[7.66-9.28]You were right to shut it down.
OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_1835: Hi, Jesse.
OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_1836: Bring me back anything good?
OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_1837: What’s up?
OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_1838: The longer I study the Hiss, the more questions I have. 
OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_1839: Good to see you.
OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_1840: Need something looked at?
OPCONV_EP_INTRO_POPE_1841: If Darling were here, I bet we’d be close to solving all this.
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_1000: [0.41-1.68]I just picked up a gun...[3.00-4.75]Or a gun picked me.
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_1001: I’ll see you later, Langston.
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_1804: I can't tell if that's creepy or normal here. 
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_1805: Did he say singing?
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_1807: Trench certainly had his favorites.
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_982: Do you like working at the FBC?
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_985: How do you keep the Altered Items under control?
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_988: What’s the difference between Objects of Power and Altered Items?
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_992: And how does the Hiss factor into all that?
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_994: Nice metaphor. 
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_995: Did you work closely with Trench?
OPCONV_FL_01_JESSE_998: How’d you get this job?
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_1002: [0.17-0.89]I’ll be here.[1.22-2.14]Like always.
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_1806: [0.00-1.28]Flipping the lights three times.[1.28-2.07]That sort of thing.[2.62-4.65]It’s not superstition if it works.
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_1988: [0.25-1.28]It depends on the item.[1.73-3.13]Each one has different needs.[3.29-5.61]RItualistic touches go a long way.[5.71-6.45]Singing to them.
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_983: [0.17-0.54]Sure.[1.05-6.42]I mean, yeah, the drama is a bit much, but I get better benefits here than I would over at the postal service.[6.70-7.46]I checked.[7.66-8.49]Better health care.
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_984: [0.18-1.99]That’s not to say I don’t like my job, ma’am.[2.28-3.45]Been here over 15 years.[3.45-5.63]No one knows the Panopticon collection better than me.[6.31-6.86]I’m uh...[8.34-9.71]close to them, in a way.
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_989: [0.10-1.96]Think of them like storms.[2.04-7.19]Objects of Power are like tropical cyclones, or hurricanes for the uneducated.[7.58-9.64]They’re big, rare, and scary.
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_990: Of course, Directors can just bind the O.o.P. and become the eye of the storm.
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_991: [0.18-3.04]Altered Items are more like weird thunderstorms.[3.04-6.74]Some may rain frogs, some may rain corn, but they all rain something.
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_993: [0.08-2.32]It’s changing them, making them aggressive.[2.61-4.48]Now they’re all raining, I don’t know...[4.51-5.19]knives.[5.66-6.36]Knife rain.
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_996: [0.00-2.72]He spent most of his time with Darling and all them.[2.81-3.77]The inner circle.[4.12-4.92]Not that I care.
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_997: [0.25-2.96]He did stop in occasionally to scowl and smoke.[3.54-5.59]Did you know the Bureau has a no smoking policy?[6.44-7.09]It does.[7.77-8.72]Just not for Trench.[9.71-12.59]Still, he is the one who put aside funding for the Panopticon.[13.66-15.21]The man did have vision.
OPCONV_FL_01_LANGSTON_999: [0.48-2.93]Started as a junior agent because my uncle knew a guy.[2.93-9.80]From there I got put on a desk until an accident left the Containment Sector severely understaffed, [9.90-11.59]at which point I got bumped up to management.[12.19-15.64]Put in a steady eight hours a day for another ten years and voila.[16.18-17.61]Supervisor.
OPCONV_FL_02_JESSE_1003: Do you often see people with abilities like mine?
OPCONV_FL_02_JESSE_1005: Don’t worry about it.
OPCONV_FL_02_JESSE_1006: Do you know anything about an Object of Power called the Slide Projector?
OPCONV_FL_02_JESSE_1008: I hope Langston's got a pet sitter.
OPCONV_FL_02_JESSE_1009: Have you ever seen an AWE?
OPCONV_FL_02_JESSE_1011: What do you think of Marshall?
OPCONV_FL_02_JESSE_1013: How's that?
OPCONV_FL_02_JESSE_1015: I feel like he's a few minutes away from a rant about elder gods and blood rites.
OPCONV_FL_02_JESSE_1016: I’ll see you later, Langston.
OPCONV_FL_02_JESSE_1808: Just like in Ordinary, with the Slide Projector.
OPCONV_FL_02_LANGSTON_1004: [0.26-3.82]We have some paranaturally-inclined agents at the Bureau.[3.94-5.32]Nothing as impressive as you though.[6.11-7.57]Of course, we did have your brother here.[8.13-10.17]He got a special cell up top.
OPCONV_FL_02_LANGSTON_1007: [0.21-1.23]Doesn’t ring a bell.[1.44-3.80]But, Trench’s “chosen few” never tell me anything.[4.35-5.35]Not that I’m complaining.[5.86-7.56]The inner circle works nonstop.[7.56-9.48]I’m pretty sure Darling sleeps under his desk.[9.66-10.73]No thank you.[10.96-12.32]I have a cat to feed.
OPCONV_FL_02_LANGSTON_1010: [0.00-0.97]Not out in the field.[1.27-3.55]AWEs are just Altered Items doing their thing.[3.64-6.80]The Bureau goes in, locks everything down, and then they bring me back some...[6.84-10.11]clock or a gumball machine that made the town blind or something.
OPCONV_FL_02_LANGSTON_1012: [0.26-1.42]Marshall's nice enough.[1.67-3.89]Little too “special ops” for me.[4.18-5.32]Solves everything with a bullet.[5.81-10.37]Respect and ritual will placate Altered Items better than any gun.
OPCONV_FL_02_LANGSTON_1014: [0.23-6.89]Some people believe Altered Items are conduits to extradimensional forces which require ritualistic worship to be appeased.[8.31-9.97]It’s just a theory I heard.[9.97-11.34]I don’t know much about it.
OPCONV_FL_02_LANGSTON_1017: [0.09-0.79]I’ll be here.[0.96-1.96]Like always.
OPCONV_FL_02_LANGSTON_2036: [0.47-3.89]Darling put his own people in charge, like I couldn’t be trusted.[3.92-5.23]I couldn’t even get into the room.[5.41-7.06]In my own Panopticon![7.06-7.38]Ugh![7.91-10.93]I tell you, the way that Darling runs things, there oughta be an investigation.[11.41-13.09]Anyway, what were we talking about?
OPCONV_FL_03_JESSE_1018: Can I get a situation report for the sector?
OPCONV_FL_03_JESSE_1020: Hard to imagine the FBC at job fairs.
OPCONV_FL_03_JESSE_1022: Considering the alternative, I’m happy with stable-ish.
OPCONV_FL_03_JESSE_1023: [0.10-2.41]Any thoughts on me serving as Director?[3.05-4.54]I know it was a sudden change.
OPCONV_FL_03_JESSE_1025: I’ll try to keep my head on straight.
OPCONV_FL_03_JESSE_1026: Will you stay on after things calm down, Langston?
OPCONV_FL_03_JESSE_1028: I'll do what I can.
OPCONV_FL_03_JESSE_1029: I’ll see you later, Langston.
OPCONV_FL_03_JESSE_1809: He must have gotten a pet sitter.
OPCONV_FL_03_LANGSTON_1019: [0.12-4.42]Woof, OK, uh, we still have to perform a proper inventory of the cells.[4.42-6.98]Lord knows how many Altered Items snuck out during all this.
OPCONV_FL_03_LANGSTON_1021: [0.00-4.38]The Hiss are still tearing up the place faster than we can fix it, but the Containment Sector is stable...[4.95-5.43]ish.
OPCONV_FL_03_LANGSTON_1024: [0.14-3.31]No complaints so far.[3.76-5.26]Trench was all secrets.[5.26-7.11]Lots of meetings behind closed doors.[7.33-8.50]You seem much more...[9.31-10.04]approachable.
OPCONV_FL_03_LANGSTON_1027: [0.22-1.85]Are you asking if I’m quitting?[2.38-3.64]No, ma’am![3.86-7.14]I'm not having some mid-level agent make a mess of my Panopticon.
OPCONV_FL_03_LANGSTON_1030: [0.62-1.50]I’ll be here.[2.05-3.35]Like always.
OPCONV_FL_03_LANGSTON_2053: [0.03-0.61]Staffing.[0.87-2.33]We definitely lost some people.[2.57-6.14]Gonna have to hit those college career fairs, am I right?
OPCONV_FL_03_LANGSTON_2054: [0.36-3.06]But if I can give you some advice, ma’am: [3.08-4.96]keep a grip on who you are.[5.46-11.20]I’ve been here a long time and I don’t know if it’s the job or this place,[11.22-14.29]but people change here, and not for the better.
OPCONV_FL_03_LANGSTON_2055: [0.19-3.56]Plus, I’m racking up serious overtime hours with this lockdown.[4.00-6.03]Just don’t take too long clearing out the Hiss.[6.06-8.80]My cat gets separation anxiety.
OPCONV_FL_INTRO_LANGSTON_971: [0.19-1.87]Is the TV back in its box yet?[2.21-3.30]No rush or anything.[3.30-6.36]It’s just, you know, an ongoing concern.
OPCONV_FL_INTRO_LANGSTON_972: [0.14-0.91]Hi there, ma’am.[1.09-2.88]How’s the fridge repair coming along?
OPCONV_FL_INTRO_LANGSTON_973: [0.47-3.71]I really appreciate you helping catch these Altered Items, ma’am.[5.30-7.45]I’m not really a field work type of guy.
OPCONV_FL_INTRO_LANGSTON_974: [0.00-0.56]Hello, ma’am.[0.86-3.19]I heard about your little tussle over in Nostalgia.[3.84-8.30]So, a good house cleaning and things will get back to normal, right?[8.77-9.19]Right?[9.88-11.49]I mean, our normal anyway.
OPCONV_FL_INTRO_LANGSTON_975: [0.29-1.72]Let me know when the Hiss are gone.[2.38-3.79]I miss my desk.
OPCONV_FL_INTRO_LANGSTON_976: Is this a good time to talk about hazard pay?
OPCONV_FL_INTRO_LANGSTON_977: [0.29-1.95]Can I get a new security detail?[2.19-4.06]I don’t think these guys like me.
OPCONV_FL_INTRO_LANGSTON_978: What do you need?
OPCONV_FL_INTRO_LANGSTON_979: Ma’am.
OPCONV_FL_INTRO_LANGSTON_980: Welcome back, ma’am.

OPCONV_RU_01_JESSE_1207: That’s all you had to say.
OPCONV_RU_01_JESSE_1208: What have you learned about the Mold?
OPCONV_RU_01_JESSE_1210: So it grows fast?
OPCONV_RU_01_JESSE_1212: [0.40-2.53]So the Mold is coming in from...[3.33-3.91]where?
OPCONV_RU_01_JESSE_1214: It’s weird how excited she is, right?
OPCONV_RU_01_JESSE_1215: What do you know about the Hiss?
OPCONV_RU_01_JESSE_1217: [0.29-1.15]Calm down.[2.06-4.44]Just keep your HRA on and I’m sure you’ll be fine.
OPCONV_RU_01_JESSE_1219: [0.51-1.37]Not quite.[1.97-4.29]Just keep your head down while I handle the Hiss.
OPCONV_RU_01_JESSE_1220: I need to get going.

OPCONV_RU_01_OPTION5: End Conversation
OPCONV_RU_01_UNDERHILL_1202: [0.59-3.49]Not long enough to understand their inane methodology.[3.96-5.97]They want me to “solve” the Mold, [5.98-10.75]but how is one to solve anything when the basic molecular structure of this fungus is an utter enigma?
OPCONV_RU_01_UNDERHILL_1205: [0.23-1.38]It’s rhetorical.[2.13-6.08]The Bureau wants to control, not comprehend.
OPCONV_RU_01_UNDERHILL_1206: But to answer your question, I’m a seasoned Threshold researcher that’s been brought in on a provisional basis to resolve this matter.
OPCONV_RU_01_UNDERHILL_1209: [0.47-6.66]Firstly, the term “mold” is a gross oversimplification used only to ease communication.[7.38-13.35]That said, the Mold itself appears to be the product of complex micro-organisms.
OPCONV_RU_01_UNDERHILL_1211: If you’re not going to listen, then why did you ask?
OPCONV_RU_01_UNDERHILL_1213: [0.82-3.37]We don’t have a name for the Threshold dimension.[3.58-8.70]The origin point has been identified, but the density of the fungus makes it impossible to enter.[9.16-14.86]Even if we could, I speculate that we would only find a reality entirely subsumed by the fungus.[15.07-16.65]Total decomposition!
OPCONV_RU_01_UNDERHILL_1216: [0.19-3.11]How could I know anything about an entity I have only just learned of?[3.81-5.78]This is exactly the Bureau’s problem.[6.41-9.56]My work is always interrupted by these, these...[9.89-11.33]superfluous matters.
OPCONV_RU_01_UNDERHILL_1218: [0.15-1.46]This crude thing?[2.10-4.98]I thought it was Darling’s idea of a practical joke.
OPCONV_RU_01_UNDERHILL_1221: Try not to transport any spores outside the infected areas.
OPCONV_RU_01_UNDERHILL_3418: [0.07-6.99]They spin the Mold, building structures like miniscule cities, swiftly colonizing our dimension.[7.27-10.40]And the speed of these tiny engineers relative to their size.[10.84-12.35]Simply staggering!
OPCONV_RU_02_JESSE_1222: Have you worked with Emily Pope?
OPCONV_RU_02_JESSE_1224: I feel like there’s a “but” coming.
OPCONV_RU_02_JESSE_1226: So is Darling your boss?
OPCONV_RU_02_JESSE_1229: So tell me again how you came to work at the Bureau?
OPCONV_RU_02_JESSE_1232: And then the Mold happened?
OPCONV_RU_02_JESSE_1234: [0.71-2.76]So she’s a professor.[3.68-5.12]That explains a lot.
OPCONV_RU_02_JESSE_1235: The Mold seems to be having some weird effects on things.
OPCONV_RU_02_JESSE_1237: [0.21-1.40]Don’t eat the mold.[2.29-2.74]Okay.
OPCONV_RU_02_JESSE_1239: I never thought the word “blooming” would sound so horrible.

OPCONV_RU_02_OPTION5: End Conversation
OPCONV_RU_02_UNDERHILL_1223: [0.26-1.55]Our paths have crossed.[2.45-4.32]Darling arranged for us to have a coffee.[4.85-7.36]A meeting of the minds, he called it.[7.80-11.83]She’s talented, I can certainly see her doing well here.
OPCONV_RU_02_UNDERHILL_1225: [0.27-4.77]But she’s drunk a bit too much of the Bureau’s proverbial Kool-Aid.[5.83-8.59]She shouldn’t be afraid to forge ahead on her own.[9.33-11.08]Science is skepticism.[11.68-14.79]Everything must be questioned before the truth can emerge.
OPCONV_RU_02_UNDERHILL_1227: [0.11-5.78]If you insist on clinging to such outdated hierarchies, then yes.[7.08-11.42]However I would argue our fields are too dissimilar for one to manage the other.
OPCONV_RU_02_UNDERHILL_1228: [0.17-6.50]Of course, Darling would much prefer to find his own miracle solution to the Bureau’s fungal frustrations.[7.78-9.50]He always needs to be the hero.
OPCONV_RU_02_UNDERHILL_1230: [0.14-2.99]Well like I said, I was brought in as a special advisor.[3.15-4.59]A temporary position, you see.
OPCONV_RU_02_UNDERHILL_1231: [0.21-5.70]After a decade of admittedly fascinating work in Threshold research and regulation,[5.72-8.03]I began to chafe under the bureaucracy.[8.66-9.85]I needed a change.[10.67-12.50]Not that academia was so different.
OPCONV_RU_02_UNDERHILL_1233: [0.62-2.10]About four months ago, yes.[3.16-7.67]Since my departure from the Bureau, they hadn’t been able to find my equal in Threshold analysis.[8.89-12.91]Darling and I had kept in touch over the years, meeting at conferences and the like.[12.99-15.20]He called me and I booked a flight.[16.10-19.77]I've never been able to say no to a man with a dangerous alien biosphere.[21.89-25.01]I had to leave my post in the middle of the term, but so be it.
OPCONV_RU_02_UNDERHILL_1236: [0.20-0.97]Indeed.[1.57-3.02]Even people are susceptible.[3.02-6.60]The fungus grows rapidly within the chest cavity, killing the host.[7.84-11.19]Luckily, one must ingest the stalks to become infected.
OPCONV_RU_02_UNDERHILL_1238: [0.30-6.45]We’ve always cremated the infected bodies after autopsy, but I believe there may be another stage of maturity.[6.92-8.79]A blooming, if you will.
OPCONV_RU_02_UNDERHILL_1241: My pleasure.
OPCONV_RU_02_UNDERHILL_2301: [0.50-1.86]Although that’s not the whole truth.[2.57-5.68]I was employed here for a time, straight out of University.
OPCONV_RU_03_JESSE_1242: I assume you’ll be staying with us until the Mold is eradicated?
OPCONV_RU_03_JESSE_1244: Glad to have you along for the ride.
OPCONV_RU_03_JESSE_1245: Will the Mold be under control any time soon?
OPCONV_RU_03_JESSE_1247: So that’s a no?
OPCONV_RU_03_JESSE_1249: [0.31-3.53]With Darling gone, I’m putting Emily Pope in charge of the Research Sector.[4.60-5.53]Are you okay with that?
OPCONV_RU_03_JESSE_1251: Glad to hear it.
OPCONV_RU_03_JESSE_1252: [0.50-3.85]I had a dream, or something like one.[5.32-6.46]Darling was there.[7.84-11.85]He told me something, but I can’t remember what.[14.57-15.88]I think he’s gone.
OPCONV_RU_03_JESSE_1255: I’ll try.
OPCONV_RU_03_JESSE_1257: I’ll see you later, Raya.

OPCONV_RU_03_OPTION5: End Conversation
OPCONV_RU_03_UNDERHILL_1243: [0.38-1.12]Indeed.[1.69-6.54]Until I find a permanent  resolution to this pesky fungus business, I’ll be here.[7.08-9.21]Perhaps even beyond that, seeing as you are quite...[10.17-12.16]understaffed at the moment.[13.42-16.85]Though I hardly have a say in my own comings or goings.[17.40-21.68]Your Oldest House won’t open the exits until those Hiss monstrosities are cleared out.
OPCONV_RU_03_UNDERHILL_1246: [0.70-3.81]We were barely containing it with weekly controlled burns.[4.05-7.61]Just look at how it has spread after a few days of non-interference.[9.21-10.99]It’s beyond the Threshold now.[12.04-13.91]The floodgates are open.
OPCONV_RU_03_UNDERHILL_1248: Americans.
OPCONV_RU_03_UNDERHILL_1250: [0.23-0.94]Perfectly.[2.20-7.52]You’ve pulled Excalibur from the stone and now decree as you see fit, o queen.[8.39-10.45]What a true meritocracy we live in.
OPCONV_RU_03_UNDERHILL_1253: [3.70-4.70]Right.[8.90-10.99]Well, he’s never where one expects him to be, is he?[13.14-14.02]Well thank God.[15.08-20.01]I can finally stop writing these tedious reports that I’m sure he never even took the time to glance at.
OPCONV_RU_03_UNDERHILL_1254: If you speak to him again, can you tell him I...
OPCONV_RU_03_UNDERHILL_1256: I should be getting back to work.
OPCONV_RU_03_UNDERHILL_1258: [0.13-2.06]Dr. Underhill, if you please.
OPCONV_RU_03_UNDERHILL_7240: I hope he found what he was looking for.
OPCONV_RU_INTRO_UNDERHILL_1191: Have you collected the samples yet?
OPCONV_RU_INTRO_UNDERHILL_1192: I’m eager to hear what you find below the pit.
OPCONV_RU_INTRO_UNDERHILL_1193: [0.07-2.76]The Hiss have taken focus off my Mold.[3.36-7.51]Once you eradicate them, I do hope we can return to more pressing matters.
OPCONV_RU_INTRO_UNDERHILL_1194: Do you need something?
OPCONV_RU_INTRO_UNDERHILL_1195: [0.29-2.28]My time is something I value.[3.11-5.72]With that in mind, what do you need?
OPCONV_RU_INTRO_UNDERHILL_1196: [0.26-1.91]Have you seen Dr. Darling?[2.80-5.44]He’s been suspiciously absent of late.
OPCONV_RU_INTRO_UNDERHILL_1197: As far as lab conditions are concerned, these are not ideal.
OPCONV_RU_INTRO_UNDERHILL_1198: Oh, hello again.
OPCONV_RU_INTRO_UNDERHILL_1199: May I help you?
OPCONV_RU_INTRO_UNDERHILL_1200: The smell here becomes much more tolerable after a week or so.
OPCONV_SA_01_ARISH_1134: [0.98-2.79]“Handle” might be a bit of an optimistic way to put it.[3.55-8.27]Marshall sends her Rangers in to map them, check growth-rates, locate epicenters, take samples.[8.60-9.75]To measure stuff, basically.
OPCONV_SA_01_ARISH_1137: [0.00-2.42]A lot of times we find these little chunks in it.[2.42-3.29]It's uh...[3.60-4.11]pretty gross.
OPCONV_SA_01_ARISH_1140: [0.04-1.45]Of course.[1.73-3.04]He’s my favorite coffee break buddy.[3.66-6.15]Dude has got some crazy stories.[6.73-8.75]He probably knows more than anyone else around here, [8.77-9.99]if you can make sense of what he’s saying.
OPCONV_SA_01_ARISH_1143: [0.15-1.39]He’s from where he’s from.[2.44-5.96]There are just some stones that are better left unturned, you know?
OPCONV_SA_01_ARISH_1145: [0.45-0.96]Marshall?[1.73-3.25]Marshall's a fucking badass.[3.25-5.68]The Rangers could not ask for a better leader.[6.28-10.31]She's a little, uh, you know, intense, but given the stuff she’s seen, I’m not surprised.[11.08-13.11]She does have a bad habit of disappearing, though.
OPCONV_SA_01_ARISH_1147: [0.26-3.15]About as much as anybody, I guess.[3.71-4.48]Head of Research.[4.66-8.08]Loves to hear himself talk, all of those science-types absolutely do.[9.59-14.18]He’s been acting a little bit psycho recently, although HR told me not to use that word, so...
OPCONV_SA_01_ARISH_1149: [0.06-0.45]Me too.[0.89-2.27]You’re not the only one who’s busy, you know.
OPCONV_SA_01_ARISH_2702: [0.00-3.28]Down in Maintenance, Thresholds are used just like any other tool.[3.49-7.76]The lab coats mine Black Rock from one and Maintenance siphons water from another.[8.35-10.61]We use it for pretty much everything, except drinking.
OPCONV_SA_01_ARISH_2704: [0.00-3.14]Last time she vanished, I did some digging into the security logs.[3.64-6.03]I found camera footage of her entering the Quarry.[6.67-9.39]She was down there, alone, for days.[9.94-13.25]Now, typically that’s not allowed, but Marshall is kind of above the rules.
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_1133: How does the Bureau handle Thresholds?
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_1135: Why don’t you drink it?
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_1136: Do I even want to know?
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_1138: I didn’t want to know.
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_1139: Do you know this Ahti guy?
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_1141: Any idea where he’s from?
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_1142: I’m guessing Sweden.
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_1144: What do you think of Marshall?
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_1146: [0.13-2.12]What do you know about Dr. Darling?
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_1148: I have to go.
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_2699: Everyone thinks finding Darling will lead us to the answers, but if he’s completely lost it then what help could he be?
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_2701: Sounds like he’s done his homework.
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_2703: Where does she go?
OPCONV_SA_01_JESSE_2705: I wonder what she finds so interesting in the Quarry?
OPCONV_SA_02_ARISH_1151: [0.29-3.20]The situation is we are still up to our eyes in Hiss.[3.54-6.79]Not to mention the months of repairs it's gonna take just to get this place up and running again.
OPCONV_SA_02_ARISH_1153: [0.00-0.66]Of course it is.[1.42-4.81]You just might need to tell some Rangers to grab a wrench, once they’re done hunting Hiss.
OPCONV_SA_02_ARISH_1160: [0.09-2.07]I couldn’t be more excited.[2.07-7.97]I mean look, don’t get me wrong; Trench was fine, but you pulled us back from the brink, so...[9.55-10.86]Well, I’m honored to serve, ma’am.[11.38-13.92]I mean fuck, shit, Faden.[14.98-15.27]Sorry.
OPCONV_SA_02_JESSE_1150: So, what’s the situation in my Bureau, Arish?
OPCONV_SA_02_JESSE_1152: But is it doable?
OPCONV_SA_02_JESSE_1159: What are your thoughts on me serving as Director?
OPCONV_SA_02_JESSE_2730: He’ll get it one day.
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2707: [1.16-5.09]Look, Ahti is a subject that we try not to think about.[5.27-8.26]The Bureau has no clue what he is or where he came from.[8.26-9.41]And not for lack of trying.[10.01-16.45]For years, Salvador had him followed, had his behavior monitored, his eating habits analyzed, everything.[17.19-18.19]They even poisoned him once.
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2709: [0.57-1.31]Calm down.[1.31-2.11]It didn’t work.[2.62-6.88]You know, I think they just wanted to see how he’d respond, but he didn't even mentioned it.[6.88-8.17]He just kept on mopping.[8.84-10.41]So we left the case open and moved on.
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2712: [0.90-1.61]Not your fault.[2.38-2.98]The Hiss got him.[3.43-4.20]It was bound to happen.[4.85-7.09]He was always putting himself in the line of fire for his team.[8.45-12.92]Everything I know about this place, about this job, I learned from him.[13.98-15.72]I hope I can make him proud.
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2714: I think you’re forgetting that you did all that.
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2715: [0.23-0.43]But...[0.43-2.72]thanks, Faden.[3.55-4.73]I appreciate the vote of confidence.
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2717: [0.34-2.58]Ugh, yeah, too many times.[3.18-5.31]I do not trust the walls there, you know?[6.37-7.28]Feels like they’re watching you.
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2718: [0.97-2.39]Here’s a funny story Salvador told me.[2.95-7.59]So Marshall ordered the Rangers to go in and map the Motel, but they kept getting blocked by those locked doors, yeah?[7.70-12.64]So, one day a squad goes in with some C4 and tries to blow one of those doors open.
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2720: [0.11-1.76]And that’s it.[2.36-3.68]They were never seen again!
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2723: [0.19-1.61]I know that it represents the Board.[2.05-4.34]Or the Board represents the Pyramid.[4.76-5.57]It's hard to say which.
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2724: [0.38-4.89]Salvador told me on my first day not to trust the big pyramid, the one hanging right over our heads.[5.59-7.13]Didn't say why, never talked about it again.[7.13-13.09]But with that in mind, isn’t it interesting that we all ended up just below that exact same pyramid during this crisis.[13.95-14.84]Who planned that, I wonder?
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2726: [0.57-1.06]I don’t know.[1.88-3.08]All questions worth asking though.
OPCONV_SA_03_ARISH_2729: Don’t you worry about me, boss. 
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2706: [0.23-2.67]Okay so what’s the deal with Ahti?[2.85-5.07]He’s clearly not a regular janitor.
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2708: They tried to kill him?
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2710: [0.37-2.80]So they’re in the dark about Ahti too.[3.69-6.07]I wonder if even Ahti’s unsure of what he is.
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2711: I’m sorry about what happened to Salvador.
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2713: [0.00-2.03]You’ve saved a lot of lives, Arish.[2.47-4.96]Plus, you stopped the Power Plant from exploding.[5.63-7.19]I’d say you’re doing pretty well.
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2716: Have you ever been to the Oceanview Motel?
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2719: And?
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2721: People here have an interesting sense of humor.
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2722: What do you know about the Black Pyramid?
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2725: [0.29-2.35]Why would the Board want us all here though?[2.78-6.15]And if they did want us here, did they plan the Hiss attack?
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2727: We sound like a pair of conspiracy theorists.
OPCONV_SA_03_JESSE_2728: Stay safe out here, Arish.

OPCONV_SA_04_ARISH_2731: [0.66-3.07]First off, I’m banning all Slide Projectors, that's it.[4.57-6.86]Seriously though, we need to review our protocols.[7.58-11.31]Research should not be making decisions that endanger the entire Bureau, no fuck it,[11.32-14.39]the entire fucking world, without some serious oversight.
OPCONV_SA_04_ARISH_2733: [0.17-2.89]And I’d like to make these HRAs part of the mandatory Bureau uniform.[3.42-5.44]They're not stylish, but better safe than sorry.
OPCONV_SA_04_ARISH_2736: [0.12-4.59]Salvador never did, but I doubt he even knew.[4.59-9.68]I’m well aware that it's our job to study and contain the things that we don’t understand, but... [9.75-13.44]some of the things Darling did were way outside of our mission statement.
OPCONV_SA_04_ARISH_2737: [0.31-3.77]Look, these things are not toys, and acting like they are is only ever going to end one way.[4.67-6.14]At least Pope seems to understand that.
OPCONV_SA_04_ARISH_2739: Thank Christ for that.
OPCONV_SA_04_ARISH_2741: [0.39-3.51]Last time I saw her was in Maintenance, when I was leading the Rangers out of the Atlas.[4.08-7.87]I told her it wasn’t safe, but she said she had to go check on something.
OPCONV_SA_04_ARISH_2743: [0.73-3.04]Marshall is not the kind of person you question.[3.04-4.71]Kind of intimidating, you know?[5.58-8.17]But she was by herself, if that helps at all.
OPCONV_SA_04_ARISH_2747: You know where I'll be.
OPCONV_SA_04_JESSE_1154: So what’s next for Simon Arish?
OPCONV_SA_04_JESSE_2732: [0.82-2.14]I think Pope would agree.[2.69-6.12]Certain people in the Bureau have been working in the shadows for too long.
OPCONV_SA_04_JESSE_2734: [0.17-1.49]I don’t think anyone will complain.[2.15-3.06]Not after this.
OPCONV_SA_04_JESSE_2735: Did anyone ever mention to you that Darling was using the Slide Projector?
OPCONV_SA_04_JESSE_2738: [0.07-1.26]Well it’s secure now.[1.84-3.47]No one can reach it without my say so.
OPCONV_SA_04_JESSE_2740: [0.09-1.89]Marshall’s been missing for a while now.[2.38-3.97]Any ideas where she could be?
OPCONV_SA_04_JESSE_2742: Did you ask where she was going?
OPCONV_SA_04_JESSE_2744: [0.26-0.81]Not really.[1.28-2.33]But thanks.
OPCONV_SA_04_JESSE_2745: Hopefully she turns up.
OPCONV_SA_04_JESSE_2746: I'll see you later.
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_1121: [0.00-4.33]When the converters and coolant pumps are working again, we should be able to get this baby back down to a safe temperature.[4.80-5.45]I hope.
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_1122: [0.20-2.71]I’m getting reports that something’s tearing up the Training Grounds.[3.25-4.18]Might be worth checking out.
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_1123: [0.08-2.58]I can give you a proper tour of Maintenance when this is all over.[3.45-5.23]I’ll even make sure the blood’s mopped up first.
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_1124: [0.29-3.19]I heard you closed the Hiss portal or whatever we’re calling it.[3.89-5.40]Now if we can only flush out the stragglers!
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_1125: The crew feels a lot safer when you’re around.
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_1126: [0.14-4.57]Sometimes I look around and I just think “a desk job would be so nice”.[4.57-8.84]Fuck it, I’d probably get bored.
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_1127: [0.13-2.95]Welcome to the beating heart of the FBC.[3.74-5.43]I kinda mean that literally.
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_1128: [0.00-0.57]Welcome back.[0.57-1.66]Did you miss us?
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_1129: Hell of a day, huh?
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_1130: Anything I can help with?
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_1131: What have you got for me?
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_3318: [0.15-1.88]I put extra security on your brother.[2.26-8.84]No offense, but that dude is the scariest motherfucker I have ever laid eyes on.[8.84-10.88]Like I said though, no offense.
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_3319: [0.48-3.63]Man, I never thought I’d be working in the Executive Sector.[4.07-5.58]Look at me now, Ma.
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_3320: [0.39-1.25]Lots of work to do.[1.63-2.40]Let’s get to it, okay?
OPCONV_SA_INTRO_ARISH_3321: [0.37-2.19]The Rangers have been very cooperative.[2.39-4.93]Not one complaint about taking orders from a security guard.[5.60-6.78]Good fucking soldiers.

OPCONV_SA_M3_ARISH_1164: [0.05-1.51]Not much, only what I’ve seen.[2.17-4.81]They use the same tactics that Marshall and Salvador taught us,[4.81-8.23]which makes me think that the Hiss haven’t completely erased the people inside.[8.23-10.60]Which is a pretty fucking horrible thought.
OPCONV_SA_M3_ARISH_1166: [0.59-1.27]Shit, I don't know.[1.53-2.53]They wanna make my life harder?
OPCONV_SA_M3_ARISH_1168: [0.34-1.91]Security Chief of the Maintenance Sector.[2.33-4.77]I make sure all the weird shit down here doesn’t bother the maintenance crews.[5.07-9.41]Learned everything I know from Salvador, the best security agent this Bureau has ever seen.
OPCONV_SA_M3_ARISH_1170: [0.00-0.97]I love it.[1.80-7.18]You know, everyone thinks that Maintenance is the lowest rung on the ladder just 'cause we fix pipes instead of writing memos, [7.19-10.72]but I gotta be honest, these are the bravest people in the god damn building.[11.80-12.53]I’m proud to work with them.
OPCONV_SA_M3_ARISH_1172: [0.56-2.18]Listen, I only know what Salvador told me.[2.79-7.12]But I know it generates all the electricity for the Bureau and it's got two very simple rules.[7.46-9.67]Rule one, keep it below a certain temperature.[9.86-12.50]Rule two, don’t ever, ever open it.[13.07-16.17]Oh, and three, it’s classified so I shouldn’t ask.
OPCONV_SA_M3_ARISH_1175: [0.40-1.00]Oh yeah.[1.34-2.27]It's all part of the job.
OPCONV_SA_M3_ARISH_1177: [0.05-0.43]Right.[0.78-1.85]You’ve got a lockdown to lift.
OPCONV_SA_M3_ARISH_2693: [0.05-2.52]Or they’re just using whatever they find in their victim’s heads.[3.22-6.57]In any case, they are really eager to get inside the Power Plant.
OPCONV_SA_M3_ARISH_2696: [0.58-1.12]Not much.[1.42-2.44]That thing is Director only.[2.98-4.93]Salvador told me about the time he saw Trench use it.[5.00-7.29]Sounds like that gun can do some serious damage.[8.26-12.08]I did see pictures of it once, though, and it looks different to that thing you’re carrying.[12.38-13.19]You mod it or something?[13.42-13.90]That’s new.
OPCONV_SA_M3_ARISH_2698: Given the circumstances, I'd say “new” is our best bet.
OPCONV_SA_M3_JESSE_1163: What do you know about the Hiss?
OPCONV_SA_M3_JESSE_1165: Why do you think that is?
OPCONV_SA_M3_JESSE_1167: What do you do here, Arish?

OPCONV_SA_M3_JESSE_1171: What exactly is the Power Plant?
OPCONV_SA_M3_JESSE_1173: Sounds like secrets are standard operating procedure around here.
OPCONV_SA_M3_JESSE_1176: I should be going.
OPCONV_SA_M3_JESSE_2694: [0.12-2.60]I’ve done a few odd jobs with these kind of folks.[3.48-4.40]They say what they mean.[5.01-5.78]I like that.
OPCONV_SA_M3_JESSE_2695: What do you know about the Service Weapon?
OPCONV_SA_M3_JESSE_2697: Is "new" a good thing?
OPCONV_SA_M5_ARISH_1179: [0.69-3.20]Ugh fuck, don’t get me started on Black Rock.[3.61-6.40]You know, ever since Research found out it blocks paranatural stuff, [6.41-10.43]they have just been parading dangerous materials in and out of the fucking Quarry.[11.99-13.17]Fucking lab coats, man.[13.51-14.51]Love making my job harder.
OPCONV_SA_M5_ARISH_1181: [0.30-3.14]Still, at least the Quarry's got a good view of the night sky.[3.17-5.86]You know, me and Salvador used to have after work beers down there.
OPCONV_SA_M5_ARISH_1183: [0.73-1.23]Not often.[1.80-5.52]Rangers are specially trained in Threshold reconnaissance and ground zero AWE response.[6.01-8.61]Security is more interested in the dangers inside the Bureau.
OPCONV_SA_M5_ARISH_2700: [0.42-1.76]Oh yeah, definitely.[1.76-6.83]You know, every week they are tackling things that were previously unknown to the human experience.[7.85-11.14]Most Rangers, they retire due to “cognitive collapse”.[11.81-13.06]I looked up the medical definition.[13.66-14.09]Not fun.
OPCONV_SA_M5_JESSE_1178: What’s the deal with Black Rock?
OPCONV_SA_M5_JESSE_1180: Sounds like there’s some tension between departments.
OPCONV_SA_M5_JESSE_1182: [0.23-1.66]You’re security, right?[2.30-3.41]Do you work with Rangers?
OPCONV_SA_M5_JESSE_1184: They must see some weird stuff out there.

SM_C04_01_HOROWITZ_2349: [0.18-0.80]Hey![0.95-1.79]Is someone there?
SM_C04_01_HOROWITZ_2350: [0.05-0.92]Hello?[1.50-2.71]I need some help here.
SM_C04_01_HOROWITZ_2351: If anyone’s there, I could really use a hand.
SM_C04_01_HOROWITZ_2352: Man down!
SM_C04_01_HOROWITZ_2358: [0.08-1.49]Got in a little scrap.[1.96-3.06]Name’s Horowitz.[3.22-4.57]I-
SM_C04_01_HOROWITZ_2361: [0.13-1.47]Don’t look at me like that.[1.54-1.96]I’m fine.[2.74-4.19]But Wells is still in there.[4.19-5.19]You gotta get him out.
SM_C04_01_HOROWITZ_2363: [0.00-1.02]My squadmate.[1.29-3.09]We were hunting a runaway Altered Item.[3.39-5.16]We followed it down into the Clocks.
SM_C04_01_HOROWITZ_2365: [0.26-1.60]A Threshold.[2.23-4.95]The Bureau sealed it up years back 'cause of all the clocks.[5.95-9.81]We followed the Altered Item inside, but the way it was acting...[10.47-11.17]we weren’t ready.[12.59-15.36]Me and Wells were the only ones to make it to the Motel cord.[16.17-19.83]He was right behind me, but he never showed up on this side.
SM_C04_01_HOROWITZ_2367: [0.27-1.79]Wells is the medic![2.24-4.16]Please, you gotta get him out of there.[4.47-5.87]I’ll be fine, really.[6.37-7.76]Rupe can patch me up later.
SM_C04_01_HOROWITZ_2369: [0.16-1.67]I’d damn well hope so.[2.65-4.38]Just use the Motel cord there.[4.38-5.74]It should get you into the Clocks.
SM_C04_01_HOROWITZ_2370: Sorry, the Threshold.
SM_C04_01_JESSE_2353: Someone needs help over there.
SM_C04_01_JESSE_2354: Sounds like there’s a man down.
SM_C04_01_JESSE_2357: [0.14-0.64]I’m here.[1.58-2.59]What happened to you?
SM_C04_01_JESSE_2360: Is he going to be okay?
SM_C04_01_JESSE_2362: Who’s Wells?
SM_C04_01_JESSE_2364: The Clocks?
SM_C04_01_JESSE_2366: I’ll go find him, but first you need to get to a medic.
SM_C04_01_JESSE_2368: [0.23-0.64]Fine.[1.85-3.05]But I’ll be back for you.
SM_C04_03_JESSE_2371: This Wells guy can’t be far.
SM_C04_03_JESSE_2372: Those must be the clocks he was talking about.
SM_C04_03_JESSE_2376: That must be our guy.
SM_C04_03_WELLS_2373: [0.00-0.37]Hey![1.01-1.64]Wake up![2.23-2.77]Come on![3.12-3.81]Come on!
SM_C04_03_WELLS_2374: Don’t you die on me!
SM_C04_03_WELLS_2375: [0.03-0.87]Come on, Coleman![1.35-2.09]Wake up!
SM_C04_03_WELLS_2377: Shit!
SM_C04_04_JESSE_2378: [0.08-0.94]Are you Wells?[2.15-4.06]Your friend asked me to come looking for you.
SM_C04_04_JESSE_2380: [0.33-1.09]You tried.[1.98-2.76]That’s enough.[4.05-5.62]Horowitz needs your help now.[6.15-7.21]How do we get out of here?
SM_C04_04_JESSE_2382: [0.10-0.93]We’d better hurry.[1.82-2.42]Which way?
SM_C04_04_WELLS_2379: [0.61-1.73]That must be Horowitz.[2.37-3.30]Glad he got out.[4.24-5.79]I stayed back to help the others.[5.82-7.36]Did a shit job of it, clearly.
SM_C04_04_WELLS_2381: [0.04-1.88]We should head back through the Threshold.[2.26-4.32]We can look for other survivors as we go.
SM_C04_04_WELLS_2383: Just follow the blood.
SM_C04_05_JESSE_2386: What’s with the clocks?
SM_C04_05_JESSE_2389: Let me see.
SM_C04_05_JESSE_2390: So you came down here for an Altered Item?
SM_C04_05_JESSE_2395: [0.09-1.91]I’ll need to come deal with that Altered Item later.[2.82-6.49]If I open the Safe Room now, Wells could get hurt.
SM_C04_05_JESSE_2398: That was brave of you.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2384: Let’s go.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2385: [0.03-0.80]I can open this.[1.11-1.94]I’ve got a keycard.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2387: [0.00-1.15]Threshold effect.[1.87-5.32]This used to be a regular office wing before the Threshold manifested.[5.72-9.56]The forces at play in there got a hold of someone’s old clock and started duplicating it.[10.05-13.13]Now the office is abandoned and it’s clocks all the way down.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2388: [0.05-0.66]Locked.[1.66-3.01]Think you can find a way around?
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2391: [0.05-1.38]The Anchor, yeah.[2.29-4.69]Langston said it’d be a simple Item retrieval.[5.06-6.72]But the power that thing had.[7.13-8.90]I’ve never seen anything like it.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2392: Thanks.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2393: [0.03-0.81]That’s O’Neil.[1.33-1.95]Shit.[2.84-4.67]No one else got out.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2394: [0.03-2.39]That safe room is where the Altered Item cornered us.[3.09-4.60]We sealed the door on the way out.[5.11-6.78]We couldn’t let it get out into the Bureau.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2396: [0.05-1.06]We locked it tight.[1.77-3.49]Come on, we need to get back to Horowitz.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2397: [0.00-4.03]When it was clear we couldn’t contain the Altered Item, Horowitz ordered a retreat.[4.44-6.45]We got out, but Hiss were waiting for us.[6.98-9.64]I took Horowitz to the Motel cord and went back for the others.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2399: [0.00-0.69]I’m the medic.[1.06-1.91]It’s my job.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2400: Should be just a bit further.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2401: We’re almost out of the Threshold.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2402: We’re not far now.
SM_C04_05_WELLS_2403: Just keep going straight.
SM_C04_06_JESSE_2406: Shit.

SM_C04_07_JESSE_2417: [0.03-2.68]That Altered Item needs to be dealt with before it hurts anyone else.[3.76-5.33]I should go back down and contain it.

SM_C13_JESSE_2120: There you are.
SM_C13_JESSE_2123: [0.03-0.52]There.[1.75-5.06]I guess the Bureau should start looking for a new Head of Communications.

SM_C14_01_PHILLIP_2429: [0.15-0.58]Hello?[1.53-2.75]Is anyone there?

SM_C14_02B_PHILLIP_2446: [0.34-1.39]Oh, thank god.[1.85-5.23]Someone has to watch this object at all times or it deviates.[5.62-8.44]I’ve been staring at it since yesterday with no breaks.[8.49-10.00]You have to get me out of here.[10.00-13.72]The door can only be opened by the Panopticon supervisor.[14.03-16.38]That’s Langston, if he’s still around.

SM_C14_04_JESSE_2452: [0.07-1.89]There’s someone named Phillip up in a cell.[2.36-4.91]He’s watching a refrigerator and very rapidly losing it.

SM_C14_04_LANGSTON_2461: Being “pretty good” with Altered Items isn't standard Bureau procedure, ma’am.
SM_C14_05_JESSE_2464: [0.30-0.82]I’m back.[1.44-2.03]I’m coming in.
SM_C14_05_JESSE_2467: Phillip?
SM_C14_05_JESSE_2468: Phillip?
SM_C14_05_JESSE_2469: Agh!
SM_C14_05_JESSE_2470: If I look away, it hurts me.
SM_C14_05_JESSE_2471: [0.25-2.44]I can’t get out and I can’t look away.[4.18-5.73]Maybe I can cleanse it?

SM_C14_05_PHILLIP_2465: [0.14-1.82]Thank you.[2.05-3.98]Thank you, thank you.

SM_C14_06_FORMER_8666: # # # // # !? $$ *^^ () ### #
SM_C14_06_JESSE_2472: This sounds like the Board, but I can’t understand it.

SM_C14_06_JESSE_2474: [0.08-0.77]Wait.[1.21-2.68]There’s no Black Pyramid here...
SM_C14_07_JESSE_2475: [0.03-1.48]The Fridge seems fixed.[2.76-5.00]Did fighting that thing off change something?
SM_C14_08_JESSE_2477: [0.20-0.91]Phillip’s gone.[1.99-3.80]Something happened before I could get him out.
SM_C14_08_JESSE_2480: [0.06-1.17]The fridge is fine now.[2.28-3.22]I took care of it.

SM_C14_08_JESSE_2484: Do you think that thing is what got Phillip?
SM_C14_08_LANGSTON_2476: [0.22-0.84]How’d it go?[1.40-2.04]Where’s Phillip?
SM_C14_08_LANGSTON_2478: [1.31-2.38]Poor Phillip.[3.64-4.96]He never did like fridge duty.
SM_C14_08_LANGSTON_2479: But if you’re here, then who’s watching the fridge?
SM_C14_08_LANGSTON_2481: [0.26-2.88]You don’t just “take care” of Altered Items.[2.88-3.99]What did you do?
SM_C14_08_LANGSTON_2483: [1.50-5.64]We’ve been getting reports from the Astralnauts lately about something fitting that description.[6.16-11.02]The Astral Plane is usually connected to our world through Objects of Power, not Altered Items.
SM_C14_08_LANGSTON_2485: [0.30-0.93]Must've been.[1.81-3.62]The Panopticon is a dangerous place.[4.11-5.39]The agents all know the risks.
SM_C14_08_LANGSTON_2486: But since you’re some sort of Altered Item whisperer, I’ve got a list of others for you to corral.
SM_C14_08_LANGSTON_2487: My life just got a whole lot easier.
SM_C14_08_LANGSTON_3983: [0.33-4.73]If this thing is linking itself to Altered Items, then it's clearly powerful.[5.17-6.20]This may happen again.
SM_C14_08_LANGSTON_3984: [1.12-4.22]The Hiss are causing containment breaches left, right, and center.[4.22-5.79]Here, start with these.[6.08-7.94]I’ll see if there are any others missing while you’re gone.
SM_C14_STEP_00: Speak with the Agent in the Panopticon cell - 4th Floor

SM_C17_03_JESSE_2493: That must be one of the missing Altered Items.
SM_C17_03_JESSE_2494: That’s the Traffic Light, one of the missing Altered Items Langston is looking for.
SM_C17_03_JESSE_2495: Wait, how did I get back here?

SM_C17_05_JESSE_2505: That’s no normal piece of paper.
SM_C17_05_JESSE_2506: [0.03-3.18]That must be the Letter Altered Item Langston asked me to find.[3.97-5.42]There should be more than one page.

SM_C17_05_JESSE_2508: I need to find the other pages.

SM_C17_05_JESSE_2510: Done and done.
SM_C17_05_JESSE_2511: Enjoy your containment cell.
SM_C17_06_JESSE_2512: That’s all the Altered Items on Langston’s list.
SM_C17_06_JESSE_2513: I found all those missing Altered Items.
SM_C17_06_JESSE_2515: How many of these things did he lose?
SM_C17_06_JESSE_2516: How many?
SM_C17_06_LANGSTON_2514: [0.24-0.75]All of them?[1.31-3.28]Wow, you have a gift, ma’am.[4.00-7.70]But those weren’t all of the Altered Items missing from the Panopticon.[8.13-10.01]The Hiss must be making them restless.[10.17-12.44]We’ve had several more containment breaches.
SM_C17_06_LANGSTON_2517: [0.29-1.00]Just a couple.[1.17-2.54]Should be no problem for you.[2.69-4.90]I really appreciate your help.[4.90-5.75]Really.[5.83-7.55]Just super.
SM_C17_07_JESSE_2518: That’s got to be an Altered Item.
SM_C17_07_JESSE_2519: [0.00-1.07]The Flamingo.[1.55-3.69]One of Langston’s fugitive Altered Items.
SM_C17_07_JESSE_2520: [0.18-0.78]Shit![1.60-3.00]Okay, no touching.[3.52-4.03]Got it.

SM_C17_07_JESSE_2524: [0.04-1.43]What does this thing want?[2.08-3.47]Is it fighting the Board?
SM_C17_07_JESSE_2525: [0.00-1.48]I never did like Flamingos.[2.14-3.89]Too pink.
SM_C17_07_JESSE_2526: Another Altered Item contained.

SM_C17_08_JESSE_2528: [0.04-0.79]The Mannequin.[1.35-3.24]One of Langston’s missing Altered Items.
SM_C17_08_JESSE_2529: [0.24-0.82]God.[1.07-4.55]The only thing creepier than one mannequin is a few dozen of the damn things.
SM_C17_08_JESSE_2530: Wrong one, I guess.
SM_C17_08_JESSE_2531: This thing is pissing me off!
SM_C17_08_JESSE_2532: Okay, Jesse, it has to have a tell.
SM_C17_08_JESSE_2533: New Bureau policy: No more mannequins.
SM_C17_08_JESSE_2534: One more Altered Item for the Panopticon.
SM_C17_09_JESSE_2535: [0.18-0.94]The Globe.[1.19-3.40]That’s one of the Altered Items Langston is looking for.
SM_C17_09_JESSE_2536: Holy shit! 
SM_C17_09_JESSE_2537: Stop bouncing!
SM_C17_09_JESSE_2538: [0.00-0.28]Ooph.[0.28-2.62]I feel a little sick after that one.
SM_C17_09_JESSE_2539: One less Altered Item loose in the Bureau.
SM_C17_10_JESSE_2540: [0.28-1.43]Disappearing ducks.[1.77-2.31]Great.
SM_C17_10_JESSE_2541: This must be one of Langston’s Altered Items.
SM_C17_10_JESSE_2543: [0.15-1.13]Finally.[1.42-2.22]No more quacking.
SM_C17_10_JESSE_2544: [0.33-0.90]There.[1.33-2.67]Safe in the Panopticon.
SM_C17_11_JESSE_2545: [0.62-2.97]Every Altered Item on the list is contained.[3.75-4.69]I should tell Langston.
SM_C17_11_JESSE_2546: Every Altered Item on your list is now back in the Panopticon, safe and sound.
SM_C17_11_JESSE_2548: [0.03-2.89]The Flamingo pulled me into the Astral Plane, just like the Fridge did.[3.20-4.80]That same creature was there.
SM_C17_11_JESSE_2550: [0.05-0.37]Hmm.[1.24-2.21]Something to keep an eye on.
SM_C17_11_JESSE_2552: I guess this is my life now.
SM_C17_11_LANGSTON_2547: [0.73-1.97]That’s a load off my mind![2.62-5.94]Missing Altered Items don’t exactly reflect well on me, you know?[6.40-7.45]Did they give you any trouble?
SM_C17_11_LANGSTON_2549: [0.39-0.88]Hmm.[1.64-8.42]I was looking over the old activity reports and multiple items have been displaying much more destructive behavior in the past few weeks.
SM_C17_11_LANGSTON_2551: And if I have any more runaways, I’ll know just who to call.
SM_C17_11_LANGSTON_3985: There’s some connection there, I bet, but that’s a bit above my pay grade.
SM_EXEC_Expedition_Step_01: Ask Arish about the Jukebox Token
SM_EXEC_Expedition_Step_01_LOG: Jesse finds a strange Jukebox Token. She speaks to Arish to find out more about it.
SM_EXEC_Expedition_Step_02: Use the Token in the Jukebox
SM_EXEC_Expedition_Step_03: Discover what happened to the expedition team
SM_EXEC_Expedition_Step_04: Travel through the active gate to the island site
SM_EXEC_Expedition_Step_05: Search the site for the missing expedition team
SM_EXEC_Expedition_Step_06: Survive!
SM_EXEC_Expedition_Step_07: Speak with Arish
SM_EXEC_Expedition_Step_07_LOG_COMPLETE: Jesse learns that the Token activates the Jukebox, an Object of Power that translocates users to a place called the Formation. Jesse searches the Formation for the missing expedition team and survives a Hiss ambush.
SM_EXEC_Expedition_Title: Put a Record On
SM_EXEC_New_Expedition_Step_01: Ask Arish about the Jukebox Token
SM_EXEC_New_Expedition_Step_01_LOG: Jesse finds a strange Jukebox Token. She speaks to Arish to find out more about it.
SM_EXEC_New_Expedition_Step_02: Use the Token in the Jukebox
SM_EXEC_New_Expedition_Step_03: Complete an expedition
SM_EXEC_New_Expedition_Step_03_LOG_COMPLETE: Jesse uses the Jukebox to enter the Formation, a threshold space where she successfully completes an expedition.
SM_EXEC_New_Expedition_Title: Put a Record On
SM_EXP_01_ARISH_2554: [1.34-2.93]That is a Jukebox Token.[3.44-6.85]Little bastards turn up in the weirdest places, like bad pennies.[7.37-9.81]The Rangers use them to activate an old Object of Power.
SM_EXP_01_ARISH_2556: [0.69-2.36]Nope, just the one record.[3.03-4.23]Be careful turning it on though.[4.65-7.06]When it’s playing, you get a free trip to the Formation.
SM_EXP_01_ARISH_2559: [0.59-2.96]The Bureau has been wondering that for years.[3.59-7.19]I mean, it’s just a pile of rocks, built by God knows who, but...[7.48-14.21]Researchers have confirmed it’s in the same Threshold as the Quarry, but no-one's ever been able to map a physical route to the Formation from Maintenance.
SM_EXP_01_ARISH_2561: [0.51-1.13]Pretty much.[1.69-4.08]We only send in annual expeditions to the Formation now.[4.32-5.75]“Check ups”, Salvador calls them.[6.44-8.23]This year’s team went in the day the Hiss arrived.[9.34-11.77]Come to think of it, the song should have brought them back hours ago.
SM_EXP_01_ARISH_2563: [0.28-1.17]I’d appreciate that.[1.70-3.77]The Jukebox is kept just past the security booth over there.[4.69-6.43]Put in the Token and enjoy the ride.
SM_EXP_01_JESSE_2553: [0.11-1.23]I found this token.[1.97-3.06]Any idea what it does?
SM_EXP_01_JESSE_2555: [0.04-1.66]A Jukebox, I assume.[3.32-4.47]Does it have any good songs?
SM_EXP_01_JESSE_2557: [0.03-0.92]The Formation?[2.24-3.23]That sounds ominous.
SM_EXP_01_JESSE_2558: Why’s it send you there?
SM_EXP_01_JESSE_2560: So it’s in the Quarry, you just don’t know where?
SM_EXP_01_JESSE_2562: I can go in and take a look.
SM_EXP_02_JESSE_2564: [0.05-0.70]Stars.[1.91-4.34]That certainly looks like the same sky as the Quarry.
SM_EXP_02_JESSE_2565: Guess I should look for those Rangers.
SM_EXP_02_JESSE_2566: That must be the Formation Arish was talking about.
SM_EXP_02_JESSE_2568: Link detectors?
SM_EXP_02_JESSE_2569: [0.05-0.85]A flashing light.[1.37-2.45]They must have gone that way.
SM_EXP_02_JESSE_2570: I don’t see any Rangers.
SM_EXP_02_JESSE_2574: [0.41-0.93]The Hiss.[1.78-2.47]They’re here.
SM_EXP_02_JESSE_2575: Where’d you all come from?
SM_EXP_03_ARISH_2577: [0.26-0.70]There you are.[1.50-4.59]Did you, uh, did you find those Rangers at the Formation?
SM_EXP_03_ARISH_2579: [0.10-1.49]Another dead team.[1.64-2.08]Jesus.[3.01-4.28]You know, I should’ve seen this coming.[4.28-7.32]The Formation, it's got like a pull to it.[7.32-8.86]Things just end up there.[9.44-11.81]I’m sure you saw all the junk from the Bureau lying around.
SM_EXP_03_ARISH_2581: [1.64-2.68]Or they forced their way in.[3.51-5.27]The Formation is a just big question mark to us.[6.11-8.85]Who knows, you might even find some useful stuff down there.[9.08-12.12]All I know is we cannot let the Hiss get comfortable.
SM_EXP_03_ARISH_2583: [0.39-1.63]Uh-huh, a simple one.[2.37-5.58]You need to find more Tokens and clear the Hiss the fuck out of the Formation.
SM_EXP_03_ARISH_2585: [0.38-3.08]Oh, and I found a file on the Formation while you were gone.[3.70-4.99]Take a look for yourself, if you want.[4.99-6.63]A lot of the terms in there are way beyond me.[7.09-9.37]I don’t like to overcomplicate these situations.[9.85-11.92]When in doubt, fuck it, shoot something, right?
SM_EXP_03_ARISH_2587: I try.
SM_EXP_03_JESSE_2576: [0.00-0.88]Guess the song ended.[1.77-2.49]Good timing.
SM_EXP_03_JESSE_2578: [0.10-3.16]I found them, but it’s not good news.[4.28-5.60]The Hiss got there first.[7.15-7.75]Lots of them.
SM_EXP_03_JESSE_2580: [0.09-2.20]There were a lot of Hiss, Arish.[2.98-4.06]I mean, a lot.[5.08-6.38]Did they get pulled in too?
SM_EXP_03_JESSE_2582: Sounds like you have a plan.
SM_EXP_03_JESSE_2584: That is simple.
SM_EXP_03_JESSE_2586: Real helpful, Arish.
SM_H01_01_JESSE_2240: So what do you need from me?
SM_H01_01_JESSE_2242: And what is that exactly?
SM_H01_01_JESSE_2244: Okay. I’ll see what I can do.
SM_H01_01_POPE_2239: Jesse. I have a favor to ask. As you know, I’m gathering all available data on the Hiss. Knowledge is the key to victory. I forget who said that.
SM_H01_01_POPE_2241: Data! No one engages with the Hiss like you do. I’ve inserted data requests into a terminal, I just need you to pick some and go do what you do best.
SM_H01_01_POPE_2243: Eradicating Hiss-corrupted entities. I thought that was obvious. Every reading helps!
SM_H01_01_POPE_2245: That’s all I ask.
SM_H01_02_POPE_2246: I placed the terminal outside. You can’t miss it.
SM_H01_02_POPE_2247: The terminal is right here. Take a look.
SM_H01_02_POPE_2248: The terminal is just below the Pyramid. Can’t miss it.
SM_M01_01_JESSE_2591: I always did love obstacle courses.
SM_M01_01_JESSE_2605: Shit.
SM_M01_01_JESSE_2606: Come on!
SM_M01_01_JESSE_2607: Arggh.
SM_M01_01_JESSE_2608: Fuck you, awkward voice recording!
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2588: So... So I- I... just read this?
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2589: [0.09-2.04]Welcome to the Ranger Field Training Course.[2.12-5.42]The course must be completed in the specified amount of time.[5.42-7.28]When you’re ready to start, press the button.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2590: Is that all or-
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2592: [0.04-1.09]Get ready, Ranger.[1.56-3.00]Course starting in five.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2593: Four.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2594: Three.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2595: Two.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2596: [0.00-0.58]One.[1.37-2.42]Go!
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2597: Sixty seconds remaining.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2598: Forty-five seconds remaining.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2599: Thirty seconds remaining.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2600: Fifteen seconds remaining.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2601: Five seconds remaining.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2602: [0.03-0.82]Course failed.[1.49-2.42]Try again, Ranger.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2603: [0.03-0.80]Course complete.[1.32-2.73]Congratulations, Ranger.
SM_M01_01_SPEAKER_AUDIO_2604: Can I do that one again?
SM_M01_02_JESSE_2609: I’m guessing this isn’t usually part of the course.
SM_M01_02_JESSE_2610: It’s protecting itself.
SM_M01_02_JESSE_2611: I need to hit it harder to break that shield.
SM_M01_02_JESSE_2612: [0.03-1.37]Is that a flask?[2.76-4.83]Finally, something really useful.
SM_M01_03_BOARD_2614: [0.00-3.15]< The Copies have been given Weapons/Projectiles >[3.20-5.60]< Shield yourself to pass/level up > 
SM_M01_04_JESSE_2616: Good time to have a shield.
SM_M02_02_AHTI_2313: [0.00-0.86]Yep.[2.60-3.85]Burn the trash.[4.60-6.24]Throw it in the fire.[7.52-9.11]Burn it all.
SM_M02_02_AHTI_3431: Burn it into a reindeer, not into a moose. 
SM_M02_02_JESSE_2619: By “trash”, did Ahti mean barrels full of hazardous biological material?
SM_M02_02_JESSE_2620: Seems like I’m breaking some environmental regulations on waste disposal, but if that’s what Ahti wants, then I’ll get it done.
SM_M02_02_JESSE_2621: That’s all of them.
SM_M02_03_AHTI_2314: [0.04-0.74]It's back.[1.79-3.38]What would kill a bad thing?[4.02-5.36]Paska mikä paska.
SM_M02_03_JESSE_2624: [0.34-2.13]Hello again, Mr. Clog.[2.89-4.72]You’ve really let yourself go.
SM_M02_03_JESSE_2625: We should go down there to clear out the rest of it.
SM_M02_03_JESSE_2626: [0.30-1.57]Goodbye, Mr. Clog.[2.20-4.50]I sincerely hope we never meet again.
SM_M02_03_STEP_00: Talk to the plants
SM_M02_03_STEP_00_LOG: Jesse helps Ahti by speaking with the plants in Central Research in the Research Sector.
SM_M02_03_TITLE: What a Mess: Talk to the Plants
SM_M02_05_AHTI_2315: They are very good listeners, you can tell them anything. 
SM_M02_05_AHTI_3432: [0.21-1.83]Or you can sing to them.[2.42-3.61]They like that.
SM_M02_05_JESSE_2629: Talk to the plants.
SM_M02_05_JESSE_2630: [0.03-2.44]Small talk was never my strong suit.[3.37-4.57]At least they can’t talk back.
SM_M02_05_JESSE_2631: I need some peace and quiet to talk to these plants properly.
SM_M02_05_JESSE_2632: I hope your day has been productive, little plant.
SM_M02_05_JESSE_2633: That really works, huh?
SM_M02_05_JESSE_2634: I hope those nasty Hiss haven’t been bothering you too much.
SM_M02_05_JESSE_2635: I wish my leaves were as pretty as yours.
SM_M02_05_JESSE_2636: [0.72-2.71]Do you have a family?[4.25-5.06]I have a brother.[6.63-7.57]I miss him a lot.
SM_M02_05_JESSE_2637: [0.16-4.17]They say I’m the Director, but what does that mean?[5.09-7.24]I have no experience in leadership roles.[7.24-8.69]I have no on-the-job training!
SM_M02_05_JESSE_2638: Your chlorophyll really brings out the green in your leaves.
SM_M02_05_JESSE_2639: [0.00-4.83]That’s all of them, but I kinda wish there were more.[5.91-6.89]They’re good listeners.
SM_M02_06_AHTI_2316: [0.21-5.86]You need to scrub that clean or there goes my reputation and honor.[6.89-9.35]And then the good won't swing.
SM_M02_06_JESSE_2642: [0.47-2.61]The Mold’s really gone crazy in here.[3.65-4.71]Good thing I brought my gun.
SM_M02_06_JESSE_2643: That should be all of them.
SM_M02_07_AHTI_2317: [0.13-1.18]More of it![2.19-5.82]This thing is completely leaving from the mitten.[5.99-10.20]Perkele, saatana, helvetin helvetti.[11.10-13.36]Loma tulossa ja tällästä paskaa.
SM_M02_07_JESSE_2646: [0.12-1.60]The Mold’s gotten in here too?[2.98-3.66]All right.
SM_M02_07_JESSE_2647: Let’s get cleaning, she said, cocking her gun.
SM_M02_07_JESSE_2648: That should slow it down.
SM_M02_08_AHTI_2318: [0.40-2.56]Hurry is not good for you.[3.14-5.94]And the contract says you can take a break.
SM_M02_08_AHTI_2319: [0.06-2.71]Ten points and a parrot patch.[3.68-6.46]Now you know what this job is all about.
SM_M02_08_AHTI_3433: [0.38-1.61]Could be worse.[2.39-4.08]There are good benefits.
SM_M02_08_JESSE_2653: I guess I just take a seat?
SM_M02_08_JESSE_2654: This is what being a janitor’s all about.
SM_M02_08_JESSE_2656: I suppose the janitor’s assistant does need proper janitor attire.
SM_M05_01_ARISH_2657: [0.23-3.26]I don’t think I ever told you this, but I was actually on the path to being a Ranger once.[3.89-4.91]Did the whole bootcamp thing.[5.13-6.02]Even got rookie status.
SM_M05_01_ARISH_2658: [0.77-2.04]Anyway, not the point.[2.75-4.29]My old Ranger squad was a great bunch.[4.83-5.88]There were six, plus me.[6.68-9.51]Remus, Hazzard, Cho, Guy, Heptonstall, and Thomson.[10.16-12.17]They were supposed to get back from an expedition yesterday.[12.17-13.40]We had beers and wings planned.[14.47-17.97]Problem is, they weren’t here when Darling handed out the HRAs.
SM_M05_01_ARISH_2660: [0.24-2.83]You see, they prep for the worst, but I think that we’re already past that.[3.89-8.29]We all wore these pouches around our neck and I really don’t want the Hiss to get them.[9.16-9.89]Can you find them for me?[10.86-13.91]The squad would have come back through Maintenance, but they probably spread out from there.
SM_M05_01_JESSE_2659: Then they had nothing protecting them from the Hiss.
SM_M05_01_JESSE_2661: I’ll keep an eye out for them, Arish.
SM_M05_01_JESSE_2662: And I won’t let them stay Hiss.
SM_M05_02_JESSE_2663: [0.00-2.09]This was one of Arish’s ranger buddies.[3.60-4.69]I should find the others.
SM_M05_03_JESSE_2664: Another pouch for Arish.
SM_M05_04_JESSE_2665: Another old squad mate of Arish’s.
SM_M05_05_JESSE_2666: A pouch, just like Arish said.
SM_M05_06_JESSE_2667: They didn’t stand a chance without HRAs.
SM_M05_07_JESSE_2668: [0.00-1.74]That’s all of them.[3.41-4.72]Arish saw it coming though.[5.89-7.11]I should get these back to him.
SM_M05_09_ARISH_2670: [0.14-3.51]That’s all of them, not counting mine.[5.14-6.64]Well, I guess I’ll just have to wear all of them.[6.86-8.87]It sounds sappy, I know, but-
SM_M05_09_ARISH_2671: [0.22-1.20] That's all I can think to do. 
SM_M05_09_ARISH_2676: [0.24-2.05]The story’s confidential, but uh...[2.53-4.96]Well, I guess I can tell you, being the Director and all.[6.00-11.50]So, the Bureau had heard rumors of a werewolf gathering upstate every full moon.[12.21-14.14]Us being rookies, they sent us to confirm it was bullshit.
SM_M05_09_ARISH_2678: [0.29-5.30]Turns out there was an Altered Item that was creating violent gravitational anomalies during full moons.[6.10-8.30]Oh man, we nearly bit it that night.[9.08-15.41]To remember the occasion, we all bought silver bullets to wear around our necks, just in case we ever ran into another “werewolf”.
SM_M05_09_ARISH_2680: [0.33-1.73]Thought I could do more good here.[2.58-5.65]Somebody's gotta protect the people who protect everybody else, right?
SM_M05_09_JESSE_2669: [0.10-1.17]Here are the pouches.[2.61-4.05]I found six.
SM_M05_09_JESSE_2672: [0.01-1.75]Nothing’s easy with the Hiss.
SM_M05_09_JESSE_2673: Is it rude to ask what’s inside?
SM_M05_09_JESSE_2674: What’s inside the pouches?
SM_M05_09_JESSE_2675: Too late now.
SM_M05_09_JESSE_2677: [0.00-0.53]Hold on.[0.58-2.86]Is he about to tell me werewolves are real?
SM_M05_09_JESSE_2679: So why did you leave the Rangers?
SM_M08_01_JESSE_2682: What’s down that way?
SM_M08_01_JESSE_2683: [0.05-0.97]Is that a break room?[0.97-2.70]I could use a snack.
SM_M08_01_JESSE_2684: Whoa!
SM_M08_01_JESSE_2685: [0.03-0.39]Ugh.[1.24-3.24]This place makes me nauseous.
SM_M08_01_JESSE_2686: [0.03-1.27]An Object of Power.[2.44-3.86]How do you think it got down here?
SM_M08_01_JESSE_2687: [0.05-1.29]A carousel horse.[2.30-4.44]Why is kid stuff always so creepy?
SM_M08_02_BOARD_2689: [0.00-3.00]< Cross the chasms/level with evade >[3.01-5.20]< Do not fall into the White/Exterior >
SM_M08_03_JESSE_2691: Let’s see the Hiss keep up with me now.
SM_M08_03_JESSE_2692: I don’t think I’ll ever get used to this place.
SM_Maint_01_Shield: A Good Defense
SM_Maint_01_Shield_Step_00: Investigate the Training Course
SM_Maint_01_Shield_Step_00_LOG: Jesse learns of another Object of Power, a Safe, in the Field Training obstacle course.
SM_Maint_01_Shield_Step_01: Complete the Training Course in the required time
SM_Maint_01_Shield_Step_02: Cleanse the Safe Object of Power
SM_Maint_01_Shield_Step_03: Use Shield to complete the Astral Plane challenge

SM_R03_06_UNDERHILL_3218: I’ve finished synthesizing the samples.

SM_R03_09_JESSE_3243: [0.16-1.96]I found a big angry plant.[2.13-3.30]Like, gigantic.[3.75-4.37]I killed it.
SM_R03_09_JESSE_3245: [0.36-1.79]Her concern is touching.[2.12-2.67]Really.[2.96-3.77]It’s too much.
SM_R03_09_JESSE_3246: [0.46-0.96]Here.[1.12-2.25]I brought you a sample.

SM_R03_09_UNDERHILL_3241: [0.20-2.10]And you’re not sprouting Mold from your eyes.[2.10-3.99]I take it that means my pill worked.
SM_R03_09_UNDERHILL_3242: [0.26-1.41]Now, tell me everything.[1.95-3.19]Did you find the source?[4.17-5.59]You did, didn’t you?
SM_R03_09_UNDERHILL_3244: [0.16-1.24]You killed it?[2.31-1.24]![2.31-4.31]You found the source and you killed it?[5.10-7.66]I could have learned so much from a live specimen.
SM_R03_09_UNDERHILL_3247: [0.25-3.18]A piece of the innermost Mold.[3.53-5.43]You’re not such a lost cause after all.
SM_R03_09_UNDERHILL_3248: [0.05-1.36]Strange.[2.19-4.32]So different, even superficially.[5.64-8.21]Another stage of growth perhaps?
SM_R03_09_UNDERHILL_3250: [0.25-8.43]You’ll be pleased to know that cutting down the creature at the source has already resulted in a notable cessation of the Mold’s rapid growth.[9.44-11.50]You’ve bought me time for further study.
SM_R03_09_UNDERHILL_3252: [0.18-1.22]I’m glad you asked.[1.65-6.30]While you were busy in the pit, a number of Mold Hosts were sighted beyond the Threshold.
SM_R03_09_UNDERHILL_3253: [0.41-3.29]They managed to sneak out without the Rangers noticing.[4.19-8.97]There’s a reason I didn’t send “Steve” and “Andy” to find the Mold source with the others.[9.77-13.71]These vagrant Hosts must be eradicated as soon as possible.[14.12-17.24]The Mold can still be spread by their overgrown bodies.

SM_R03_UNDERHILL_2149: [0.29-1.08]Correct.[2.78-4.34]Perhaps you could help me.[5.08-11.47]I require samples of various Mold strains, and the Mold has made the environment far too dangerous for me to fetch them myself.
SM_R03_UNDERHILL_2151: [0.26-3.00]It could and it will, whoever you are.[3.82-5.75]The Mold is spreading.[5.75-8.66]We need to find the source before it spreads too far.
SM_R03_UNDERHILL_2153: [0.69-1.27]No.[1.75-7.48]Samples of five unique strains, when blended properly, will allow you to travel deeper into the pit, [7.49-11.79]where I've pinpointed the approximate location of the source of the Mold.

SM_R03_UNDERHILL_2171: You look like a woman with Mold for me.
SM_R03_UNDERHILL_2174: [0.34-2.37]The Mold has that effect on some people.[2.97-5.39]Likely due to the fact that it's not actually Mold...[5.39-6.86]or even of this dimension.[7.69-14.86]I suspect it is the result of two incompatible molecular structures, one dominant, coming into contact.[15.27-20.13]I call it "Mold" or "Fungus" because it's closer in appearance and behavior than anything else we know...[21.12-22.67]except perhaps bacteria.

SM_R03_UNDERHILL_2180: [0.23-1.92]But that’s nothing for you to worry about.[2.25-7.20]The pill I'm about to make with these samples will make the lower level perfectly safe to traverse.[7.83-12.01]It has the added benefit of immunizing you against the pit’s toxic spores.

SM_R03_UNDERHILL_2870: [0.23-1.92]But that’s nothing for you to worry about.[2.25-7.20]The pill I'm about to make with these samples will make the lower level perfectly safe to traverse.[7.83-12.01]It has the added benefit of immunizing you against the pit’s toxic spores.
SM_R03_UNDERHILL_2871: Now leave me to it.
SM_R03_UNDERHILL_3413: Are you going to fetch those samples or not?
SM_R03_UNDERHILL_3414: [0.39-2.11]No, don’t hurry.[2.11-3.90]The Mold will wait for you.[5.43-6.28]That was a joke.[7.11-7.94]It will not wait.[8.08-8.72]Do hurry.
SM_R15_01_JESSE_2797: [0.79-3.75]“The Forest of Positive Interactions.[4.48-7.79]” So I play this and get in the tank?[8.60-8.99]Okay.[9.78-11.38]Self-reflection can bring answers.[12.15-14.06]I read that somewhere.
SM_R15_01_JESSE_2798: This should be interesting.

SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_2800: Welcome to my guided imagery experience.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_2802: Close your eyes, open your mind, and find yourself on an empty beach. 
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_2804: [0.03-1.16]Let’s find out together.[1.99-3.79]Just walk over the waves, friend.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_2806: [0.00-1.26]The trees look lonely.[2.00-3.19]Why don’t you talk to them?
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_2808: [0.00-1.43]You whisper to the trees.[1.99-5.89]You tell them that they deserve love, that everyone deserves love.[6.60-7.57]The trees agree.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_2810: Now let’s leave these trees to their love.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_2812: [0.03-2.34]I sense a disturbance in our love-garden.[3.27-3.91]A menace.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_2814: [0.00-0.79]A forklift![1.27-3.15]It does not like the tree’s romance.[4.18-7.26]It is ruining our lovely beach with its hateful tires.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_2816: [0.03-0.80]You did it.[1.39-3.78]The murderous machine will kill no more.[4.63-6.73]The trees can love undisturbed.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6272: Exercise one: “The Forest of Positive Interactions”. 
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6274: [0.13-2.14]My name is Dr. Yoshimi Tokui.[2.33-3.37]Trust my words.[3.98-4.94]I'm here for you.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6276: The waves are rolling in and the seagulls are fighting over a discarded bag of potato chips.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6278: I believe they’re jalapeno flavored.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6279: [0.00-1.97]I see something in the middle of the ocean.[2.64-4.08]They appear to be trees.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6281: [0.31-2.13]Perhaps they are ocean trees.[2.99-6.57]Or perhaps they are metaphors for how you push people away.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6284: [0.29-5.03]They will now go on to form healthy, respectful relationships with other trees.[5.68-6.47]Or shrubs.[6.91-7.96]Whatever they prefer.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6286: Voyeurism is impolite.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6288: [0.19-0.99]Go, find it![1.54-3.83]Do not let it darken our forest of emotions.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6290: [0.27-2.11]It ran over one of the gulls![2.64-3.75]Such bloodshed![4.46-5.42]Turn off the machine![5.94-7.39]That gull had a family!
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6292: [0.10-2.37]The potato chips were for his pregnant wife![3.12-4.76]The forklift must be stopped!
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6294: [0.22-3.60]Our beach is no place for forklifts, or lonely trees.[4.89-7.34]Your mind is a safe haven for love.
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6296: [0.05-1.21]Doesn’t that feel nice?[1.77-3.12]Aren’t you feeling healthier?
SM_R15_04_INTERPRETER_6298: [0.34-3.65]Oh my, it seems we’re all out of time.[4.74-6.09]Stay receptive, friend.
SM_R15_04_JESSE_2817: [0.28-2.02]That actually was relaxing.[2.94-5.76]And strangely insightful.
SM_R15_05_JESSE_2818: [0.25-3.86]“Embracing the Erratic: An audio journey”.[4.56-6.69]This must be one of those sensory tank tapes.

SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2823: Now, close your eyes, open your mind, and find yourself on a deserted beach.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2825: [0.00-1.67]Look, a vending machine.[2.26-3.43]You must be thirsty.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2827: [0.03-1.48]They have your favorite soda.[2.08-3.17]You know the one.[3.73-4.44]Press the button.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2829: [0.03-2.64]The machine has run off with your favorite soda![3.42-4.06]Chase it!
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2831: [0.03-0.71]Fight for it![1.26-3.84]This is your favorite soda in the whole world.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2833: [0.00-1.32]The soda tumbles out![1.86-2.67]Victory!
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2835: [0.00-1.09]How delicious.[1.75-3.90]This is your new favorite soda.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2837: Ah, another personal realization awaits. 
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2839: [0.03-1.08]It’s a dead person.[1.26-4.86]This would normally be quite an upsetting thing to find, yes?
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2841: [0.03-1.49]Oh merciful gods![1.55-3.34]Dozens of more corpses appeared![3.53-4.61]Where did they come from?
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2843: [0.03-1.37]That was scary, wasn’t it?[2.00-4.23]And yet you learned another lesson.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_2845: [0.04-1.39]Lots of good lessons today![1.68-3.89]Some things are good, some are bad.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_3987: This concludes my guided imagery therapy.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6299: Welcome to my guided imagery experience.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6301: Exercise two: “Embracing the Erratic”.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6304: The waves are crashing against the rocks and the gulls are circling overhead, drawing ever closer. 
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6306: [0.08-1.35]Are you scared of birds?[2.22-4.41]If so, please try not to be.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6308: Let us go quench your thirst.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6310: [0.03-1.69]The soda you’d kill a man for![2.03-2.88]Hurry, run![3.15-3.95]Soda!
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6312: But wait, it’s not the right kind!
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6314: I guess you’ll have to try something new. 
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6316: [0.03-0.62]Go on.[1.15-1.99]You might like it.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6318: When you try new things, you sometimes discover the best of life has to offer. 
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6320: That’s a soda lesson for you.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6322: [0.00-0.69]Hurry over.[0.91-1.34]Run.[1.76-3.20]Exercise is good for you.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6324: [0.03-0.89]Do not worry.[1.12-1.92]You are safe.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6326: Why don’t you try touching the dead person.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6328: It could be interesting.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6330: [0.16-1.29]Oh, the stench![1.59-2.39]The horror![2.94-4.73]This beach will never be the same.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6332: [0.00-1.96]Why did you touch the dead person?[2.11-3.81]You made a grave mistake!
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6334: Fix your mistake by hiding it! 
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6336: [0.09-1.16]Bury these bodies![1.62-3.01]Clean your mind of the rot!
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6338: You’re scared of some things for a reason.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6340:  Listen to your instincts, accept that the world is random and cold. 
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6342: Fear is useful.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6344:  Don’t you feel more prepared for the uncaring cruelty of life? 
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6346: I know I do.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6348: [0.17-6.09]You are now approved by Dr. Yoshimi Tokui to explore this rotating rock we call Earth.
SM_R15_06_INTERPRETER_6350: [0.10-1.47]Good luck, star wanderer.[2.06-3.20]Stay actualized.[3.91-5.16]And see you next time.
SM_R15_06_JESSE_2846: [0.09-1.70]I will stay actualized.[2.34-3.73]Thanks, Dr. Yoshimi.
SM_R15_06_JESSE_2847: [0.59-1.54]I feel good![1.96-2.83]Real good![3.58-5.09]Thanks, Dr. Yoshimi.
SM_R15_06_JESSE_2848: [0.35-0.86]Yeah![1.09-3.22]I’m Jesse fucking Faden![3.85-5.75]You’re the best, Dr. Yoshimi.

SM_R17_02_JESSE_2849: There’s one of those Mold Hosts.
SM_R17_02_JESSE_2850: [0.10-1.56]I think that’s the last one.[2.56-3.64]I should let Underhill know.
SM_R17_03_JESSE_2851: [0.31-1.30]I found the Hosts.[1.61-2.95]They won’t be spreading any more Mold.
SM_R17_03_JESSE_2853: You don’t sound very optimistic.
SM_R17_03_JESSE_2856: This woman has some incredible tunnel vision.
SM_R17_03_UNDERHILL_2852: [0.31-1.07]Well done.[1.55-3.98]I’ll send burn teams to sanitize the locations.[5.06-11.18]I am beginning to wonder if these Hosts are originating outside the Threshold, in independent patches of Mold growth.
SM_R17_03_UNDERHILL_2854: Optimism is for farmers, as my mother always said.
SM_R17_03_UNDERHILL_2855: I suppose you can now return to that Hiss business you all seem so concerned about.

SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4308: Don't let them near you!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4309: Those things are volatile!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4310: Kill 'em before they explode!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4311: It's those poppers!

SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4332: This one's got an arm!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4333: That's a big boy.
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4334: This one seems pissed!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4335: It'll tear this place apart!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4336: Buckle up!

SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4347: Is it wearing heels?
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4349: How's she doing that?
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4350: Did you see that?
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4351: Hope she's on our side.
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4352: Whoa!

SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4422: The Director's airborne!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4423: She can fly?
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4424: Why can't we fly?
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4425: What can't she do?
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4426: Don't hit the flying lady!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4427: She can fly now?

SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4476: That one was a little dicey.
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4477: The Hiss aren't making this easy.
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4478: Thanks for the back-up, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4479: Seeing you in the field means a lot, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4480: Phew. Glad that's over.
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4482: We've got a flying Director!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4483: So fucking cool!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4484: There she goes!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4485: Eyes in the sky!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4486: Death from above!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4487: How's the view?
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4488: Director is airborne!
SYS_GUARD_01_GUARD_1_4489: Hell yeah!

SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4563: We have an agent down!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4564: We have a man down!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4565: Keep it together!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4566: We're losing people!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4567: They're killing us!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4568: We're getting slaughtered!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4569: We're dying out here!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4570: We can't keep this up!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4571: We're getting routed!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4572: We can't hold!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4573: There's too many!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4574: We're losing ground!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4575: We're outnumbered!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4576: We can't hold them!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4577: We need to fall back!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4578: We're all gonna die!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4579: There are so many!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4580: They're overwhelming us!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4581: We can't stop them!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4582: Look alive!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4583: Eyes up!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4584: We got this!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4585: Brace yourselves!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4586: Let's put 'em down!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4587: More hostiles incoming!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4588: Enemy reinforcements!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4589: Hostiles incoming!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4590: Additional hostiles!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4591: More hostiles! Look alive!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4592: This isn't over yet!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4593: More Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4594: More Hiss incoming!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4595: Hiss reinforcements!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4596: They don't know when to quit!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4597: This one's different.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4598: I've got a bad feeling about this.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4599: I don’t like the look of this one.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4600: That one looks nasty.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4601: What's with this Hiss?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4602: This is bad.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4603: That Hiss seems… worse.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4604: Watch that Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4605: Powerful Hiss in the field!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4606: Target that Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4607: It's over.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4608: Thank god that's over.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4609: Is that all of 'em?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4610: I've seen worse.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4611: Hostiles terminated!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4612: Room is clear!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4613: Hostiles are down!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4614: That's that!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4615: Jesus, that was a close one.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4616: Can't believe we survived that.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4617: No Hiss in sight!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4618: Hiss are down!


SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4619: That'll teach the Hiss.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4620: Area clear of hostiles!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4621: That's all of them for now.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4622: Shit!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4623: Holy shit!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4624: Oh, shit!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4625: Fuck!

SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4637: That's a big one!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4638: It's armored!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4639: They brought the big guns!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4640: Find cover!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4641: It's got a chain gun!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4642: It's got a grenade launcher!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4643: Heavy fire incoming!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4644: This one means business!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4645: Keep your head down!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4646: It's like a tank!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4647: Keep your distance!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4648: Don't get too close!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4649: Don't let them near you!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4650: Those things are volatile!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4651: Kill 'em before they explode!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4652: It's those poppers!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4653: Kill 'em before they blow!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4654: They're gonna blow!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4655: Stay away from them!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4656: Kill 'em quick!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4658: Up there!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4659: It's above us!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4660: Enemy overhead!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4661: Hiss in the sky!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4662: It's flying!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4663: We've got flying Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4664: They're airborne!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4665: Watch the sky!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4666: Eyes up!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4667: Look up there!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4669: That one throws shit!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4670: This is gonna hurt!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4671: Wrecking ball incoming!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4672: Watch its projectiles!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4673: This one's got an arm!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4674: That's a big boy.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4675: This one seems pissed!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4676: It'll tear this place apart!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4677: Buckle up!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4678: Put a shirt on!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4679: Do you hear that?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4680: I heard something.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4681: There's something in here!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4682: We're not alone in here!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4683: What in the fuck?!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4684: It's the monster!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4685: What the fuck is that?!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4686: Is that even Hiss?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4687: Kill it! Kill it!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4688: Is it wearing heels?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4690: How's she doing that?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4691: Did you see that?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4692: Hope she's on our side.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4693: Whoa!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4694: Watch your heads!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4695: Christ, she can throw.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4696: Careful!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4697: Where'd she come from?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4698: She's good!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4699: Keep up the pressure!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4700: Hell yeah!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4701: I like her already!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4702: Enemy down!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4703: That's how we do it!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4704: One down!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4706: Is that a civilian?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4707: Who is she?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4708: Civilian! Watch your fire!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4709: Are you new?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4710: Who the hell are you?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4711: Did Marshall send you?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4712: Friendly in the field!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4713: Not bad!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4714: Who are you again?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4715: Pretty damn good!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4716: I like her!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4717: You're not half bad!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4718: Thanks for the help.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4719: Hoo yeah!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4720: Look at her go!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4721: Trench never did that!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4722: Watch out!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4723: Special delivery!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4724: She's Launching!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4725: She's the artillery!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4726: She can Launch!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4727: Wish I could do that!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4728: Now that's a Director!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4730: One less Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4731: I like this new Director!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4732: Down for the count!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4733: She's good!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4734: She's kinda scary!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4735: Glad she's on our side!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4736: Nice hit!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4737: Another one down!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4738: She's a pro!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4739: Keep it up, Director!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4741: It's the new Director!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4742: Glad you're here!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4743: Welcome to the party!

SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4745: Thanks for the back-up!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4746: Reinforcements are here!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4747: Let's show her how it's done!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4748: How about a hand?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4749: We're in this together!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4750: We're glad you're here!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4752: She's got my vote.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4753: Thanks for the help.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4754: That's all of 'em.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4755: Hiss didn't stand a chance.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4756: Hostiles down!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4757: Room's clear!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4758: I'm glad you showed up.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4759: We appreciate the assist.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4760: You didn't even need us.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4761: Nice to see a Director out in the field.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4762: Are you seeing this?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4763: The Director's airborne!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4764: She can fly?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4765: Why can't we fly?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4766: What can't she do?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4767: Don't hit the flying lady!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4768: She can fly now?
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4769: Never seen that before!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4770: That's new!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4771: There she goes!

SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4779: Watch out!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4780: Take 'em down, Director!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4781: Don't get in her way!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4782: She's rocking it!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4783: Hit 'em hard!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4784: Now that's a Director!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4785: Get 'em, boss!
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4786: Bad ass!

SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4814: Thanks for having our backs.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4815: You saved the day, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4816: I'm glad you're in charge.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4817: That one was a little dicey.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4818: The Hiss aren't making this easy.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4819: Thanks for the back-up, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4820: Seeing you in the field means a lot, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_02_GUARD_2_4821: Phew. Glad that's over.

SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4926: Brace yourselves!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4927: Let's put 'em down!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4928: More hostiles incoming!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4929: Enemy reinforcements!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4930: Hostiles incoming!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4931: Additional hostiles!

SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4936: Hiss reinforcements!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4937: They don't know when to quit!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4938: This one's different.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4939: I've got a bad feeling about this.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4940: I don’t like the look of this one.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4941: That one looks nasty.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4942: What's with this Hiss?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4943: This is bad.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4944: That Hiss seems… worse.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4945: Watch that Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4946: Powerful Hiss in the field!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4947: Target that Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4948: It's over.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4949: Thank god that's over.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4950: Is that all of 'em?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4951: I've seen worse.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4952: Hostiles terminated!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4953: Room is clear!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4954: Hostiles are down!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4955: That's that!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4956: Jesus, that was a close one.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4957: Can't believe we survived that.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4958: No Hiss in sight!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4959: Hiss are down!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4960: That'll teach the Hiss.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4961: Area clear of hostiles!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4962: That's all of them for now.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4963: Shit!

SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4980: They brought the big guns!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4981: Find cover!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4982: It's got a chain gun!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4983: It's got a grenade launcher!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4984: Heavy fire incoming!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4985: This one means business!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4986: Keep your head down!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4987: It's like a tank!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4988: Keep your distance!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4989: Don't get too close!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4990: Don't let them near you!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4991: Those things are volatile!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4992: Kill 'em before they explode!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4993: It's those poppers!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4994: Kill 'em before they blow!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4995: They're gonna blow!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4996: Stay away from them!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4997: Kill 'em quick!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_4999: Up there!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5000: It's above us!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5001: Enemy overhead!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5002: Hiss in the sky!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5003: It's flying!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5004: We've got flying Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5005: They're airborne!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5006: Watch the sky!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5007: Eyes up!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5008: Look up there!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5010: That one throws shit!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5011: This is gonna hurt!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5012: Wrecking ball incoming!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5013: Watch its projectiles!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5014: This one's got an arm!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5015: That's a big boy.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5016: This one seems pissed!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5017: It'll tear this place apart!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5018: Buckle up!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5019: Put a shirt on!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5020: Do you hear that?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5021: I heard something.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5022: There's something in here!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5023: We're not alone in here!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5024: What in the fuck?!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5025: It's the monster!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5026: What the fuck is that?!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5027: Is that even Hiss?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5028: Kill it! Kill it!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5029: Is it wearing heels?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5031: How's she doing that?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5032: Did you see that?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5033: Hope she's on our side.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5034: Whoa!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5035: Watch your heads!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5036: Christ, she can throw.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5037: Careful!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5038: Where'd she come from?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5039: She's good!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5040: Keep up the pressure!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5041: Hell yeah!

SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5045: One down!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5047: Is that a civilian?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5048: Who is she?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5049: Civilian! Watch your fire!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5050: Are you new?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5051: Who the hell are you?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5052: Did Marshall send you?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5053: Friendly in the field!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5054: Not bad!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5055: Who are you again?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5056: Pretty damn good!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5057: I like her!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5058: You're not half bad!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5059: Thanks for the help.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5060: Hoo yeah!

SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5068: Wish I could do that!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5069: Now that's a Director!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5071: One less Hiss!

SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5101: You didn't even need us.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5102: Nice to see a Director out in the field.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5103: Are you seeing this?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5104: The Director's airborne!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5105: She can fly?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5106: Why can't we fly?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5107: What can't she do?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5108: Don't hit the flying lady!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5109: She can fly now?
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5110: Never seen that before!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5111: That's new!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5112: There she goes!

SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5121: Take 'em down, Director!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5122: Don't get in her way!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5123: She's rocking it!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5124: Hit 'em hard!
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5125: Now that's a Director!

SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5156: You saved the day, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5157: I'm glad you're in charge.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5158: That one was a little dicey.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5159: The Hiss aren't making this easy.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5160: Thanks for the back-up, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_03_GUARD_3_5161: Seeing you in the field means a lot, ma'am.

SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5267: Brace yourselves!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5268: Let's put 'em down!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5269: More hostiles incoming!

SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5277: Hiss reinforcements!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5278: They don't know when to quit!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5279: This one's different.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5280: I've got a bad feeling about this.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5281: I don’t like the look of this one.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5282: That one looks nasty.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5283: What's with this Hiss?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5284: This is bad.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5285: That Hiss seems… worse.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5286: Watch that Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5287: Powerful Hiss in the field!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5288: Target that Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5289: It's over.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5290: Thank god that's over.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5291: Is that all of 'em?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5292: I've seen worse.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5293: Hostiles terminated!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5294: Room is clear!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5295: Hostiles are down!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5296: That's that!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5297: Jesus, that was a close one.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5298: Can't believe we survived that.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5299: No Hiss in sight!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5300: Hiss are down!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5301: That'll teach the Hiss.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5302: Area clear of hostiles!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5303: That's all of them for now.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5304: Shit!

SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5321: They brought the big guns!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5322: Find cover!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5323: It's got a chain gun!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5324: It's got a grenade launcher!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5325: Heavy fire incoming!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5326: This one means business!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5327: Keep your head down!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5328: It's like a tank!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5329: Keep your distance!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5330: Don't get too close!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5331: Don't let them near you!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5332: Those things are volatile!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5333: Kill 'em before they explode!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5334: It's those poppers!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5335: Kill 'em before they blow!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5336: They're gonna blow!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5337: Stay away from them!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5338: Kill 'em quick!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5340: Up there!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5341: It's above us!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5342: Enemy overhead!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5343: Hiss in the sky!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5344: It's flying!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5345: We've got flying Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5346: They're airborne!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5347: Watch the sky!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5348: Eyes up!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5349: Look up there!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5351: That one throws shit!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5352: This is gonna hurt!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5353: Wrecking ball incoming!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5354: Watch its projectiles!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5355: This one's got an arm!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5356: That's a big boy.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5357: This one seems pissed!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5358: It'll tear this place apart!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5359: Buckle up!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5360: Put a shirt on!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5361: Do you hear that?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5362: I heard something.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5363: There's something in here!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5364: We're not alone in here!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5365: What in the fuck?!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5366: It's the monster!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5367: What the fuck is that?!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5368: Is that even Hiss?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5369: Kill it! Kill it!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5370: Is it wearing heels?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5372: How's she doing that?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5373: Did you see that?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5374: Hope she's on our side.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5375: Whoa!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5376: Watch your heads!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5377: Christ, she can throw.

SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5408: She can Launch!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5409: Wish I could do that!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5410: Now that's a Director!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5412: One less Hiss!

SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5436: That's all of 'em.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5437: Hiss didn't stand a chance.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5438: Hostiles down!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5439: Room's clear!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5440: I'm glad you showed up.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5441: We appreciate the assist.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5442: You didn't even need us.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5443: Nice to see a Director out in the field.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5444: Are you seeing this?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5445: The Director's airborne!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5446: She can fly?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5447: Why can't we fly?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5448: What can't she do?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5449: Don't hit the flying lady!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5450: She can fly now?
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5451: Never seen that before!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5452: That's new!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5453: There she goes!

SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5462: Take 'em down, Director!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5463: Don't get in her way!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5464: She's rocking it!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5465: Hit 'em hard!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5466: Now that's a Director!

SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5487: Good timing, Director!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5488: Make way for the Director!
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5489: The Hiss are in for it now!

SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5497: You saved the day, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5498: I'm glad you're in charge.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5499: That one was a little dicey.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5500: The Hiss aren't making this easy.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5501: Thanks for the back-up, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5502: Seeing you in the field means a lot, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_04_GUARD_4_5503: Phew. Glad that's over.

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5608: Brace yourselves!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5609: Let's put 'em down!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5610: More hostiles incoming!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5611: Enemy reinforcements!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5612: Hostiles incoming!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5613: Additional hostiles!

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5618: Hiss reinforcements!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5619: They don't know when to quit!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5620: This one's different.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5621: I've got a bad feeling about this.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5622: I don’t like the look of this one.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5623: That one looks nasty.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5624: What's with this Hiss?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5625: This is bad.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5626: That Hiss seems… worse.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5627: Watch that Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5628: Powerful Hiss in the field!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5629: Target that Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5630: It's over.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5631: Thank god that's over.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5632: Is that all of 'em?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5633: I've seen worse.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5634: Hostiles terminated!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5635: Room is clear!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5636: Hostiles are down!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5637: That's that!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5638: Jesus, that was a close one.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5639: Can't believe we survived that.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5640: No Hiss in sight!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5641: Hiss are down!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5642: That'll teach the Hiss.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5643: Area clear of hostiles!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5644: That's all of them for now.

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5662: They brought the big guns!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5663: Find cover!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5664: It's got a chain gun!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5665: It's got a grenade launcher!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5666: Heavy fire incoming!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5667: This one means business!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5668: Keep your head down!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5669: It's like a tank!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5670: Keep your distance!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5671: Don't get too close!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5672: Don't let them near you!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5673: Those things are volatile!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5674: Kill 'em before they explode!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5675: It's those poppers!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5676: Kill 'em before they blow!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5677: They're gonna blow!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5678: Stay away from them!

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5688: Watch the sky!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5689: Eyes up!

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5692: That one throws shit!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5693: This is gonna hurt!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5694: Wrecking ball incoming!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5695: Watch its projectiles!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5696: This one's got an arm!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5697: That's a big boy.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5698: This one seems pissed!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5699: It'll tear this place apart!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5700: Buckle up!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5701: Put a shirt on!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5702: Do you hear that?

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5709: Is that even Hiss?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5710: Kill it! Kill it!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5711: Is it wearing heels?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5713: How's she doing that?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5714: Did you see that?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5715: Hope she's on our side.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5716: Whoa!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5717: Watch your heads!

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5729: Is that a civilian?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5730: Who is she?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5731: Civilian! Watch your fire!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5732: Are you new?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5733: Who the hell are you?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5734: Did Marshall send you?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5735: Friendly in the field!

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5747: She's Launching!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5748: She's the artillery!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5749: She can Launch!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5750: Wish I could do that!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5751: Now that's a Director!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5753: One less Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5754: I like this new Director!

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5773: We're glad you're here!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5775: She's got my vote.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5776: Thanks for the help.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5777: That's all of 'em.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5778: Hiss didn't stand a chance.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5779: Hostiles down!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5780: Room's clear!

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5782: We appreciate the assist.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5783: You didn't even need us.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5784: Nice to see a Director out in the field.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5785: Are you seeing this?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5786: The Director's airborne!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5787: She can fly?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5788: Why can't we fly?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5789: What can't she do?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5790: Don't hit the flying lady!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5791: She can fly now?
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5792: Never seen that before!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5793: That's new!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5794: There she goes!

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5803: Take 'em down, Director!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5804: Don't get in her way!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5805: She's rocking it!

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5828: Good timing, Director!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5829: Make way for the Director!
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5830: The Hiss are in for it now!

SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5838: You saved the day, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5839: I'm glad you're in charge.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5840: That one was a little dicey.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5841: The Hiss aren't making this easy.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5842: Thanks for the back-up, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_05_GUARD_5_5843: Seeing you in the field means a lot, ma'am.

SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5962: I've got a bad feeling about this.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5963: I don’t like the look of this one.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5964: That one looks nasty.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5965: What's with this Hiss?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5966: This is bad.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5967: That Hiss seems… worse.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5968: Watch that Hiss!

SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5975: Hostiles terminated!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5976: Room is clear!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5977: Hostiles are down!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5978: That's that!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5979: Jesus, that was a close one.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5980: Can't believe we survived that.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5981: No Hiss in sight!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5982: Hiss are down!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_5983: That'll teach the Hiss.

SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6003: They brought the big guns!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6004: Find cover!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6005: It's got a chain gun!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6006: It's got a grenade launcher!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6007: Heavy fire incoming!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6008: This one means business!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6009: Keep your head down!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6010: It's like a tank!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6011: Keep your distance!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6012: Don't get too close!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6013: Don't let them near you!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6014: Those things are volatile!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6015: Kill 'em before they explode!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6016: It's those poppers!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6017: Kill 'em before they blow!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6018: They're gonna blow!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6019: Stay away from them!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6020: Kill 'em quick!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6022: Up there!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6023: It's above us!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6024: Enemy overhead!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6025: Hiss in the sky!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6026: It's flying!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6027: We've got flying Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6028: They're airborne!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6029: Watch the sky!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6030: Eyes up!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6031: Look up there!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6033: That one throws shit!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6034: This is gonna hurt!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6035: Wrecking ball incoming!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6036: Watch its projectiles!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6037: This one's got an arm!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6038: That's a big boy.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6039: This one seems pissed!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6040: It'll tear this place apart!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6041: Buckle up!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6042: Put a shirt on!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6043: Do you hear that?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6044: I heard something.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6045: There's something in here!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6046: We're not alone in here!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6047: What in the fuck?!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6048: It's the monster!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6049: What the fuck is that?!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6050: Is that even Hiss?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6051: Kill it! Kill it!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6052: Is it wearing heels?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6054: How's she doing that?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6055: Did you see that?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6056: Hope she's on our side.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6057: Whoa!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6058: Watch your heads!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6059: Christ, she can throw.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6060: Careful!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6061: Where'd she come from?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6062: She's good!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6063: Keep up the pressure!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6064: Hell yeah!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6065: I like her already!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6066: Enemy down!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6067: That's how we do it!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6068: One down!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6070: Is that a civilian?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6071: Who is she?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6072: Civilian! Watch your fire!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6073: Are you new?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6074: Who the hell are you?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6075: Did Marshall send you?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6076: Friendly in the field!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6077: Not bad!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6078: Who are you again?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6079: Pretty damn good!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6080: I like her!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6081: You're not half bad!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6082: Thanks for the help.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6083: Hoo yeah!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6084: Look at her go!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6085: Trench never did that!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6086: Watch out!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6087: Special delivery!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6088: She's Launching!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6089: She's the artillery!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6090: She can Launch!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6091: Wish I could do that!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6092: Now that's a Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6094: One less Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6095: I like this new Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6096: Down for the count!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6097: She's good!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6098: She's kinda scary!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6099: Glad she's on our side!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6100: Nice hit!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6101: Another one down!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6102: She's a pro!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6103: Keep it up, Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6105: It's the new Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6106: Glad you're here!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6107: Welcome to the party!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6108: That's the new Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6109: Thanks for the back-up!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6110: Reinforcements are here!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6111: Let's show her how it's done!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6112: How about a hand?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6113: We're in this together!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6114: We're glad you're here!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6116: She's got my vote.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6117: Thanks for the help.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6118: That's all of 'em.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6119: Hiss didn't stand a chance.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6120: Hostiles down!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6121: Room's clear!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6122: I'm glad you showed up.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6123: We appreciate the assist.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6124: You didn't even need us.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6125: Nice to see a Director out in the field.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6126: Are you seeing this?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6127: The Director's airborne!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6128: She can fly?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6129: Why can't we fly?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6130: What can't she do?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6131: Don't hit the flying lady!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6132: She can fly now?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6133: Never seen that before!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6134: That's new!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6135: There she goes!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6137: Stand clear!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6138: Whoa!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6139: I felt that!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6140: Hot damn!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6141: That's gotta hurt!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6143: Watch out!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6144: Take 'em down, Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6145: Don't get in her way!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6146: She's rocking it!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6147: Hit 'em hard!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6148: Now that's a Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6149: Get 'em, boss!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6150: Bad ass!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6151: Here it comes!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6152: Heads down!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6154: That's how we do it!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6155: She's making us look bad!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6156: Nice one!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6157: No problem!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6158: One less Hiss!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6159: She has all the fun!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6160: One down!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6161: The Director's got this!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6162: Nice one, Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6163: Give 'em hell, ma'am!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6165: Director in the field!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6166: Nice to have you in the field!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6167: We could use a hand, Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6168: Follow her lead!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6169: Good timing, Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6170: Make way for the Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6171: The Hiss are in for it now!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6172: We're with you, Director.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6173: It's an honor, Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6174: We're in for a show!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6176: She doesn't mess around.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6177: Thank you, Director.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6178: Thanks for having our backs.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6179: You saved the day, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6180: I'm glad you're in charge.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6181: That one was a little dicey.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6182: The Hiss aren't making this easy.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6183: Thanks for the back-up, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6184: Seeing you in the field means a lot, ma'am.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6185: Phew. Glad that's over.
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6187: We've got a flying Director!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6188: So fucking cool!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6189: There she goes!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6190: Eyes in the sky!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6191: Death from above!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6192: How's the view?
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6193: Director is airborne!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6194: Hell yeah!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6195: She's going up!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6196: Look at her go!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6198: So much power!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6199: They definitely felt that!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6200: She packs a punch!
SYS_GUARD_06_GUARD_6_6201: They never saw it coming.
