AMB_IN04_GREEN_ROOM_WAKE_23722=[0.03-0.72]That was...[0.75-1.48]interesting.
AMB_IN04_GREEN_ROOM_WAKE_23723=[0.11-1.16]I didn’t see that coming.
AMB_IN04_GREEN_ROOM_WAKE_23724=[0.10-1.38]That was pretty good.
AMB_IN04_GREEN_ROOM_WAKE_23725=[0.10-1.41]How do I get out of here?
AMB_IN04_GREEN_ROOM_WAKE_23726=[0.05-2.39]The TV wasn’t showing me the way forward.
AMB_IN04_GREEN_ROOM_WAKE_23727=[0.03-1.42]There had to be a way out.
AMB_IN04_GREEN_ROOM_WAKE_23728=[0.03-0.85]A vision?

AMB_IN04_TALKSHOW_STAGE_01_WAKE_23720=[0.00-1.42]It just keeps going, huh?
AMB_IN04_TALKSHOW_STAGE_01_WAKE_23721=[0.03-1.50]I guess there’s another verse...
AMB_IN04_TALKSHOW_STAGE_02_WAKE_23732=[0.08-2.87]And I thought this place couldn’t get any stranger...

AMB_RE01_ABANDONED_STORE_CASEY_4291=[0.00-2.31]You forgot the UFO cover ups.
AMB_RE01_ABANDONED_STORE_CASEY_4298=[0.03-2.44]Let’s just see this body, shall we?
AMB_RE01_ABANDONED_STORE_MULLIGAN_4295=[0.03-2.02]Thornton, he’s joking.
AMB_RE01_ABANDONED_STORE_THORNTON_12968=[0.03-8.28]I get that the UFO thing was a joke, but you’re probably trained to joke about it, right?[8.28-8.67]To deflect.[9.11-11.20]Hide the truth from the average Joe.
AMB_RE01_ABANDONED_STORE_THORNTON_12969=[0.03-0.88]But you can trust me.[0.88-2.48]I’ve been doing some deep research online.[2.48-10.00]And I know how to keep confidential matters, uh, confidential.

AMB_RE01_BF_STREETS_MULLIGAN_7065=[0.08-1.96]What are you talking about, Thornton?
AMB_RE01_BF_STREETS_SAGA_4316=[0.00-2.56]Have you heard of this Cult of the Tree, sheriff?
AMB_RE01_BF_STREETS_SAGA_4326=[0.00-2.25]Hey, what do you know about that waitress from the diner?
AMB_RE01_BF_STREETS_SAGA_4328=[0.03-1.65]She kept saying that my daughter drowned.[2.43-3.27]She even knew my name.[3.27-5.36]It was all very weird.
AMB_RE01_BF_STREETS_THORNTON_7064=[0.09-2.50]Hey, thanks for all this nice weather!
AMB_RE01_BF_STREETS_THORNTON_7066=[0.08-4.49]You know, like it was raining a lot but now it’s not.[4.49-8.97]‘Cuz Agent Anderson is here, with all that good weather she brought with her.
AMB_RE01_BF_STREETS_TIM_4318=[0.03-1.07]Only the urban legend.[1.35-3.15]If you’re in the woods at night, the Cult will get you.[3.46-4.05]That sort of thing.
AMB_RE01_BF_STREETS_TIM_4320=[0.03-3.83]I did play some D and D back in the day and wizard was always my favorite class.

AMB_RE01_BF_STREETS_TIM_4329=[0.00-2.39]Rose has a talent for saying the weirdest thing possible.[2.39-5.00]Best not to take it personally.
AMB_RE01_BF_STREETS_TIM_4330=[0.03-6.41]Sarah, my cousin, the previous sheriff, warned me some pretty weird stuff goes on around here.[6.74-11.39]I’ve only been in town a couple of years, but I’ve seen my fair share of weird.
AMB_RE01_BF_STREETS_WOMAN_7061=[0.03-2.86]I bet they’re looking into that nursing home up the hill.[3.67-5.67]Mismanagement or some such.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_CASEY_16120=[0.00-3.03]Hey, Logan’s birthday is coming up.[3.16-6.22]I need toy ideas.

AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_CASEY_16125=[0.00-1.24]Please, Anderson.[1.45-3.68]Just one case without the ridi-
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_CASEY_16127=[0.03-0.75]I don’t get it.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_CASEY_16129=[0.00-1.54]I’m getting flashbacks.[2.48-3.66]Remember Ohio?
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_CASEY_16131=[0.00-1.22]The trees, Anderson.[1.60-4.07]He hid the bodies in the forest.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_CASEY_16133=[0.00-1.45]They’re fine, Anderson.[2.05-3.29]What’s got you so worried?
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_CASEY_16135=[0.33-2.77]They can manage without you for a few days.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_CASEY_16137=[0.00-2.07]Cases aren’t good or bad, Anderson.[2.62-3.87]They’re just cases.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_SAGA_16121=[0.03-0.55]Toys?[0.55-4.13]She’s 14, Casey.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_SAGA_16123=[0.00-1.02]Get her a book.[1.57-3.33]Something weird and dark.[3.91-5.59]Maybe that will get her back into reading.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_SAGA_16124=[0.00-3.30]Hey Casey, what’s the forest’s favorite shape?
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_SAGA_16126=[0.03-1.02]A tree-angle.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_SAGA_16128=[0.00-1.02]Yes, you do.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_SAGA_16130=[0.03-0.48]Sure.[0.83-2.53]The Northside Slasher.[3.70-5.64]But that case was completely different.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_SAGA_16132=[0.00-1.07]Maybe I should call David.[1.34-2.53]See how Logan’s doing.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_SAGA_16134=[0.03-1.92]I just feel bad being gone so long.[2.77-4.59]I’ve never taken a case this far from them.
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_SAGA_16136=[0.00-2.78]This is a good case so far, don’t you think?
AMB_RE01_CL_ADDITIONAL_SAGA_16138=[0.00-4.23]Okay, sure, but you have to admit this one is particularly interesting.
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_01_CASEY_7038=[0.00-4.15]Look, Anderson, you’re a better detective than I am.[4.83-7.20]You’ve cracked cases that had the rest of us baffled.[7.80-9.35]I don’t want to slow you down.
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_01_CASEY_7040=[0.00-0.52]Mhm.[1.25-2.69]Real funny, Anderson.
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_01_CASEY_7042=[0.03-1.03]I like the rain.[1.81-4.39]The only thing around here that feels like home.
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_01_CASEY_7044=[0.04-3.19]If they did, next coffee is on me.
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_01_CASEY_7046=[0.00-0.39]Hmm.[0.75-2.75]If getting back to nature is your thing.
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_01_SAGA_7037=[0.00-0.66]Hey, Casey.[1.49-2.72]You putting me in charge.[3.41-4.02]Why now?
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_01_SAGA_7039=[0.03-1.16]Are you thinking of retiring?[2.73-5.87]You know what happens to cops who say this is their last case.
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_01_SAGA_7041=[0.00-0.46]Damn.[1.36-2.44]Should have brought an umbrella.
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_01_SAGA_7043=[0.00-2.22]You think the local law had the sense to put up a tarp?
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_01_SAGA_7045=[0.00-1.61]Not a bad place to get murdered.
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_02_CASEY_7052=[0.00-2.71]A tripod for a camera?[3.54-5.88]To record a snuff film?
AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_02_CASEY_7054=[0.00-3.02]To stuff in something for us to find.

AMB_RE01_CL_FOREST_02_SAGA_7053=[0.03-0.54]Maybe.[1.77-4.47]And why take out his heart just to throw it away?
AMB_RE01_CL_PARKING_LOT_CASEY_12967=[0.00-2.50]Agent Anderson has her methods, deputy.[2.54-4.38]Her results speak for themselves.[4.77-6.69]You will learn to trust it.[7.42-8.50]I certainly have.[9.38-11.98]And speak of the devil.
AMB_RE01_CL_PARKING_LOT_MULLIGAN_16066=<< Mulligan facial reaction to Thornton 4286: "I’m just saying. You know I’m usually a calm person. Yoga, three times a week. But these god damn city folk always think they know everything. It gets on my fucking nerves."
AMB_RE01_CL_PARKING_LOT_MULLIGAN_4285=[0.00-1.30]Shut up, Thornton.[1.30-6.07]They can still hear you.
AMB_RE01_CL_PARKING_LOT_MULLIGAN_4287=[0.07-2.43]Shut up, shut up, shut up.
AMB_RE01_CL_PARKING_LOT_THORNTON_4284=[0.03-0.93]Are they gone?[1.19-2.85]These fucking out-of-towners.[3.51-6.75]We could handle this ourselves if they’d just stay the hell out of it.[6.98-7.64]All of them!
AMB_RE01_CL_PARKING_LOT_THORNTON_4286=[0.22-1.23]I’m just saying.[1.63-3.43]You know I’m usually a calm person.[3.61-5.41]Yoga, three times a week.[5.76-9.37]But these god damn city folk always think they know everything.[9.76-11.88]It gets on my fucking nerves.
AMB_RE01_CL_PARKING_LOT_THORNTON_4288=[0.22-1.78]For fuck’s sake!
AMB_RE01_DINER_01_ED_4305=[0.00-1.58]I can’t believe that happened.[2.97-4.65]I still feel like I’m gonna be sick.
AMB_RE01_DINER_01_ED_4307=[0.00-1.09]How can you be so calm?
AMB_RE01_DINER_01_ED_4309=[0.07-3.52]This is exactly why I hate small towns.
AMB_RE01_DINER_01_TAMMY_4306=[0.00-0.83]Come on, Ed.[1.02-1.96]Have some pie.[2.17-4.00]It will take your mind off things.
AMB_RE01_DINER_01_TAMMY_4308=[0.00-1.42]Corpses are part of the job.[1.90-3.26]Can’t dwell on it too much.
AMB_RE01_DINER_01_TAMMY_4310=[0.00-1.07]Keep it down, Ed.[1.82-3.63]You know how touchy these rural types can be.
AMB_RE01_DINER_02_ED_4311=[0.35-0.76]So...[1.71-2.62]we’re not being arrested.
AMB_RE01_DINER_02_ED_4313=[0.00-1.36]Thank god.[3.24-6.52]Hey, think they serve avocado toast here?
AMB_RE01_DINER_02_TAMMY_4312=[0.12-1.16]We’re all good, Ed.[1.52-2.55]You can ease up now.
AMB_RE01_DINER_02_TAMMY_4314=[0.19-1.84]I wouldn’t count on it.
AMB_RE01_OUTSIDE_DINER_CASEY_16113=[0.04-3.08]We’ve looked through the case files you sent over, sheriff.[3.80-7.93]Have you had many people besides the known victims go missing?
AMB_RE01_OUTSIDE_DINER_CASEY_16115=[0.03-0.82]Let me guess.[1.37-4.23]Missing person cases spiked around 2010.[5.01-6.92]The fence was built just after.
AMB_RE01_OUTSIDE_DINER_CASEY_16385=[0.00-0.45]Hmm.
AMB_RE01_OUTSIDE_DINER_CASEY_16386=[0.00-1.11]You can go ahead, Anderson.[1.95-2.68]We’ll be here.
AMB_RE01_OUTSIDE_DINER_TIM_16114=[0.06-4.11]Sure, but it’s slowed down ever since Cauldron Lake was fenced off.
AMB_RE01_OUTSIDE_DINER_TIM_16116=[0.77-2.82]Yeah, that’s exactly right.
AMB_RE02_CL_ILMO_7197=[0.00-0.65]Hey![1.61-2.71]Where are you going?
AMB_RE02_CL_ILMO_7198=[0.00-1.62]Why don’t you come over and say hi!
AMB_RE02_CL_ILMO_7199=[0.00-0.72]Hey![0.99-2.42]You’re FBI, right?[2.88-5.05]Are you here about that murder?
AMB_RE02_CL_ILMO_7201=[0.00-1.06]What’d you find there, Steven?
AMB_RE02_CL_ILMO_7204=[0.03-3.01]I’d be happy to get you VIP tickets into Coffee World.[3.80-4.70]Just say the word.
AMB_RE02_CL_ILMO_7206=[0.07-1.57]We brew our own beer too.[1.98-2.77]Ahma beer.
AMB_RE02_CL_SHORE_CASEY_7209=[0.00-3.52]Yeah, the PI from your books has the same name as me.[3.83-4.57]Great.[5.07-6.22]Moving on.
AMB_RE02_CL_SHORE_CASEY_7210=[0.00-2.43]It’s a bit of a hike to the car, Wake.[2.98-5.65]Get your bearings, then we’ll head out.
AMB_RE02_CL_SHORE_CASEY_7212=[0.00-0.85]Take your time.[1.43-3.78]But you should know these woods aren’t the safest.
AMB_RE02_CL_SHORE_CASEY_7214=[0.03-1.41]I have a light.[1.85-2.70]And a gun.[3.18-4.59]You can relax, Wake.
AMB_RE02_CL_SHORE_CASEY_7216=[0.00-1.59]We know about the pages, Wake.[1.99-3.52]We’ll keep an eye out for them.
AMB_RE02_CL_SHORE_CASEY_7218=[0.99-1.95]Take your time.

AMB_RE02_CL_SHORE_WAKE_7215=[0.03-0.54]And pages?[1.18-4.82]If you see pages of writing anywhere, you must take them and keep them safe.[4.95-6.43]Our lives could depend on it.[6.84-7.99]They have vital information.

AMB_RE02_CL_STEVEN_7200=[0.00-1.02]What the hell is this?
AMB_RE02_CL_STEVEN_7202=[0.00-3.60]Nothing, just something that shouldn’t be here.
AMB_RE02_CL_STEVEN_7203=[0.00-1.43]Raccoons, my ass.
AMB_RE02_CL_STEVEN_7205=[0.00-2.58]Thanks, but I don’t drink coffee.

AMB_RE05_PATS_ROOM_PAT_2984=[0.00-3.63]The Valhalla Nursing Home is old, very old.[4.14-6.60]The government built a bunker here during World War II.[6.63-11.02]To watch the ocean for Axis navies and who knows what else.[11.84-16.23]Ever since they sealed the bunker, it’s been a hot spot for teens.[16.71-19.97]The Oceanview Motel and Spa, they call it.[19.97-21.80]Ironically, I believe.[22.61-25.47]They go there to enjoy their beer and their...[25.47-26.87]vapes.[26.87-28.79]Electronic cigarettes.[29.15-30.03]Ridiculous.[30.55-31.75]The future is...

AMB_RE07_CL_SHORE_02_ESTEVEZ_13386=[0.00-0.85]He is too fast for me.[0.97-1.41]Shoot him.

AMB_RE08_ELDERWOOD_TAMMY_12648=[0.00-2.79]Nothing hits harder than a new Wake novel.
AMB_RE08_ELDERWOOD_TAMMY_12649=[0.04-4.84]After Return, you’ll struggle to find reasons to keep living.
AMB_RE08_ELDERWOOD_TAMMY_12650=[0.00-2.17]Don’t read it in the dark!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_DONNA_12620=[0.03-6.51]Wake deftly tricks the reader into believing the Cult of the Tree is the story’s antagonist.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_DONNA_12621=[0.03-3.47]The worlds and characters echo each other in unique and surprising ways.[3.47-7.80]The Overlap scenes in particular are rich examples of this theme.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_DONNA_12622=[0.03-4.25]The novel begins as a murder mystery but pulls the rug out from under-[4.29-7.72]and turns into an all-out supernatural horror!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_ED_12611=[0.00-5.96]The Deerfest scene is a strong contender for the most memorable ending in literature!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_ED_12612=[0.05-2.54]The book begins in the victim’s point of view.[2.72-5.22]A confident move by a veteran author.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_ED_12613=[0.00-3.90]Among the scares, humor glows in Wake’s pages.[4.17-12.20]The cult’s symbol and name resulting from a mushroom trip is evidence that Wake is winking at the reader.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_1_12626=[0.03-3.62]Alan Wake knows his fans and never lets them down!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_1_12627=[0.00-2.51]Thrilling, moody, and captivating.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_1_12628=[0.03-3.42]Return has readers on the edge of their seats!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_2_12629=[0.03-2.38]A spellbinding tour de force.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_2_12630=[0.03-2.89]Return is a story that can’t help but pull you in.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_2_12631=[0.03-3.40]Return is an early contender for a Pulitzer prize.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_3_12632=[0.00-5.07]From terrifying supernatural dimensions to the quirky fun of Deerfest,[5.12-8.21]Return’s tone is flawlessly executed!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_3_12633=[0.00-5.70]Nightingale’s shocking death at the beginning is the first in a non-stop parade of shocks!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_3_12634=[0.03-3.02]The unanswered mystery is what stays with you the longest.[3.32-5.73]Was Ahti really a resident of the nursing home?[6.29-7.75]Perhaps we’ll never know.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_4_12635=[0.00-5.47]The tragedy of Saga losing her family is a blatant commentary-[5.51-10.12]on a woman’s struggle to balance their personal and professional lives.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_4_12636=[0.03-8.34]Wake brings back his most famous character only to make the reader question who this Alex Casey really is![8.84-12.13]Everyone in this story wears many faces!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_4_12637=[0.09-2.27]This story is a monster!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_5_12638=[0.00-3.09]Wake is Scratch is Zane is Wake![3.14-4.82]Shifting identities![4.96-6.42]Fractured mirrors![6.75-11.48]Dive into the dark depths of postmodernist narrative!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_5_12639=[0.00-2.34]We are made to care about Jaakko-[2.42-7.53]just so we can recoil when he is bloodily butchered by Scratch.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_5_12640=[0.32-6.54]A chilling dive into the dark waters of Alan Wake’s brilliant mind.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_LIVING_WORLD_NPC_6_12641=[0.03-2.87]This motherfucker is a home run.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_MANDY-MAY_12614=[0.09-10.16]Setting the trilogy’s exciting conclusion at Deerfest makes Return a genre-bending mixture of fact and fiction.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_MANDY-MAY_12615=[0.03-3.43]The Old Gods of Asgard are back![3.81-7.93]Wake clearly knows what his fans want to see!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_MANDY-MAY_12616=[0.04-9.68]The stage fight scene in “Departure” is one-upped by the absolutely mind-frying Dark Ocean Summoning.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_NORMAN_12617=[0.10-7.50]The gut-wrenching ending in which Saga is left to die in the lake is modern horror at its finest.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_NORMAN_12618=[0.08-3.73]Where do I sign up to live at the Valhalla Nursing Home?[3.91-7.28]Its residents are laugh-out-loud funny!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_NORMAN_12619=[0.09-5.55]I didn’t understand what was going on half the time but I loved every word of it!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_PAT_MAINE_12623=[0.03-4.63]Saga and Casey will go down as literature’s best law enforcement duo![5.86-9.35]The salt shaker story had me rolling on the floor!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_PAT_MAINE_12624=[1.18-3.28]Why no love for Barry?[3.51-7.44]Is our dear author planning something for the future?[8.59-11.55]Whatever it is, I’m on board!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_PAT_MAINE_12625=[0.03-3.71]The book continually subverts expectations.[4.71-11.11]I expected the Koskelas to become Taken because of their similarities to the Huotari brothers.
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_TAMMY_12608=[0.03-4.60]Alan Wake’s latest novel, Return, is breaking every literary record in existence.[4.84-7.58]It’s THE great American novel!
AMB_RE08_IDYLLIC_BF_TAMMY_12609=[0.03-3.92]Return shines a light on its author’s brilliantly dark mind.

AW2_QR_DEER_01_WAKE_2853=I was trapped here. Had been for what felt like years. Outside reality, what we count as real.
AW2_QR_DEER_01_WAKE_2854=I wrote to find a way out. I wrote to master this place. To learn its secrets. Use that knowledge to rewrite my reality.
AW2_QR_DEER_01_WAKE_2855=Once upon a time, I’d written hardboiled crime books set in New York City. Till I was sick of it. The Alex Casey books. A detective solving cases of murder, corruption and madness in the dark city.
AW2_QR_DEER_01_WAKE_2856=This place tapped into my unconscious mind. Drew from there. Twisting what it stole into a nightmare that took shape around me. A mystery. A detective story. I needed a detective to guide me. Echoes of Casey haunted me.
AW2_QR_DEER_02_WAKE_2857=The Dark Place was an endless waking dream. I saw visions, carried by the ebb and flow of different dream states. They seeped in from the reality beyond. Things I had a connection to, but also things I couldn’t possibly know. 
AW2_QR_DEER_02_WAKE_2858=I used them in my writing. To make it real. So that the parts that weren’t would become so. 
AW2_QR_DEER_02_WAKE_2859=And there were visions that I knew were not real. Ideas I had lost. Often of Casey. I’d written about him for years. I used them as well. 
AW2_QR_DEER_02_WAKE_2860=The lies had to feel true for them to become true.
AW2_QR_DEER_02_WAKE_2861=Had I always written this way? Even before? Seen things without realizing I was seeing them? Thinking they were mine. Was this what inspiration was for me?
AW2_QR_DEER_03_WAKE_2862=A beginning. A primordial forest. The colors of the fall. The mist. A caldera lake. Silence echoes. Loud. It’s too late to hear the words. 
AW2_QR_DEER_03_WAKE_2863=The man, naked. Crawls to the shore. Like a birth. To say that would be a lie. Nothing like a birth. The opposite. He staggers to his feet. A carcass of a deer lies on the shore. Rotting. Amidst driftwood. 
AW2_QR_DEER_03_WAKE_2864=The man is afraid. Beside himself. Who is he? He doesn’t himself know. Dark waves have washed it away. A blank page where this horror story will be written. He remembers darkness. Feels the shadow pressing down on him. Coming after him. He must get away. He runs to the forest. 
AW2_QR_DEER_03_WAKE_2865=To a fate worse than death.

CASE_MAIN_FIND_TOR=The Anderson Brothers
CASE_MAIN_FIND_TOR_COMPLETED=I rescued Tor Anderson - my grandfather - from the Dark presence. He says I have special abilities that run in our family. I also learned that the Clicker has the power to amplify Wake's writing. 
CASE_MAIN_FIND_TOR_IN_PROGRESS=With Wake in FBC custody and me off the case, my options are limited. Can Tor and Odin help me?
CASE_MAIN_MURDER_AT_CL=Murder At Cauldron Lake
CASE_MAIN_MURDER_AT_CL_COMPLETED=I killed Nightingale. I had to. He was a monster. The flooding around Cauldron Lake receded afterward. Nothing about this makes rational sense. We found Alan Wake, a writer missing for 13 years,  at the shore of the lake. Hopefully he can shed some light on this...
CASE_MAIN_MURDER_AT_CL_IN_PROGRESS=Another body has been found in the woods near Bright Falls. Is there a connection to the killings we're here to investigate?
CASE_MAIN_NO_WAY_OUT=The Mind Place
CASE_MAIN_NO_WAY_OUT_COMPLETED=The Dark Place tried to weaponize my anxieties against me. I won't let it turn me into a Taken. I'm stronger than that, and Logan needs me.

CASE_MAIN_STOP_CULT=The Trail of the Cult
CASE_MAIN_STOP_CULT_COMPLETED=I need to bring the Clicker to Wake, but I still have questions. Who were those guys in the photo with the Clicker - Tor and Odin. What are they hiding?
CASE_MAIN_STOP_CULT_IN_PROGRESS=If Wake is telling the truth, the "Clicker" is the best lead I currently have. But where is it?
CASE_META_ANDERSON_FAMILY=Fact vs. Fiction
CASE_META_ANDERSON_FAMILY_COMPLETED=Wake's story generated a strange and surreal alternate life for me. But it also revealed something: I DO have roots in this town.
CASE_META_ANDERSON_FAMILY_IN_PROGRESS=According to Wake, the story is changing people's memories. What is fact and what is fiction?
CASE_META_CULT_TREE=The Cult of the Tree
CASE_META_CULT_TREE_COMPLETED=The Cult of the Tree was being run by the Koskela brothers. They served as a sort of "neighborhood watch" against the Taken. Not the bad guys here.
CASE_META_CULT_TREE_IN_PROGRESS=To stop a cult, we need to understand them. Who is involved, and what do they want?
CASE_META_FBC=The FBC
CASE_META_MANUSCRIPT_COMPLETED=I feel like I could spend a lifetime trying to understand all of this and still have questions. Even so, I feel like I'm grasping how all this works a bit better now.
CASE_META_MANUSCRIPT_IN_PROGRESS=I feel like I could spend a lifetime trying to understand all of this and still have questions. Still, this makes more sense than it did.
CASE_META_PREVIOUS_MURDERS=The Previous Murders
CASE_META_PREVIOUS_MURDERS_COMPLETED=This isn't a serial killer, but an organized group calling themselves "The Cult of the Tree." This is a very different case now, I'll need to reassess the evidence. I should open a new case file.
CASE_META_PREVIOUS_MURDERS_IN_PROGRESS=Wake wrote a book in the Dark Place called "Return." Scratch edited it into a horror story. I need to learn more.
CASE_META_RETURN=The Story
CASE_POI_CULT_STASH=Cult Stashes
CASE_POI_CULT_STASH_COMPLETED=I think I've finally found all the cult stashes in the area. Sure were a lot of these scattered around.
CASE_POI_CULT_STASH_IN_PROGRESS=I found a stash of Cultist supplies. I should keep an eye out and see if there are others.
CASE_POI_NURSERY_RHYMES=Nursery Rhymes
CASE_POI_NURSERY_RHYMES_COMPLETED=An FBC researcher was working with nursery rhymes to create a gateway to the Dark Place. The experiment was a success, but not the way he'd hoped.
CASE_POI_NURSERY_RHYMES_IN_PROGRESS=An FBC researcher was working with nursery rhymes to create a gateway to the Dark Place. 
CASE_POI_ROSE_STASH=Alex Casey Lunchboxes
CASE_POI_ROSE_STASH_COMPLETED=Rose was leaving the lunch boxes. She was using them to fight Taken, but also hoped the hero of Wake's story would find the supplies useful.
CASE_POI_ROSE_STASH_IN_PROGRESS=I found an Alex Casey lunch box with manuscript fragments inside. Who does this belong to? Are there others?

COLLECTIBLE_ECHO_IN05_02_PRESHOW_RITUAL_ED_DP_19295=[0.00-1.60]Yeah, that’s me.[1.88-6.25]Our performance of “The Cult” was cursed from the pre-show ritual on.[6.41-9.70]“The Cult” is an immersive theatrical experience.

COLLECTIBLE_ECHO_IN05_05_ROOM_666_CASEY_DP_19298=[0.00-7.09]Mr. Scratch, if that’s who the actor of the Devil was, had stayed in the hotel. [7.66-11.16]Asking around at reception got me a room number:[12.13-14.66]666. [14.77-17.72]He had requested that room specifically. [18.17-21.10]The devil had a sense of humor,[21.11-23.77]or he really didn’t. [23.78-26.14]It was funny either way.[26.44-29.98]According to the director, the actor hadn’t mingled with the rest of the cast.

COLLECTIBLE_ECHO_IN05_07_TIRED_CASEY_DP_19306=[0.00-4.07]It was all a play, shadows on the wall of a cave, [4.14-8.14]an echo of the true events that happened somewhere else.[8.36-13.29]Was I there to watch the shadows, or was I a shadow too,[13.50-17.29]in a performance set up for someone else?

A lone man, an artist, wandering the stars until his destiny puts him straight in the cult's path. All black cast? A musical? A rock OPERA?

What with all the predators out there, usually you’re telling folks that you found their dogs dead, their cats eaten, you know... and so it felt real good to give some good news. Even if Coffee Bean is in kind of rough shape. The fur will grow back, sure, but... Well, I suppose that’s all I should say about that.”

DIORAMA_CL_NEWSPAPER_EMAIL_BODY=To many people, hackers are the stuff of Hollywoord movies and TV shows; dark criminals commiting cyber crimes in action movies. But to many people around the world, hackers are a very real threat. Cyber crime experts warn that "phishing" attempts are on the rise... and show little sign of stopping. What is "phishing" you may be asking yourself. "Phishing" is when someone poses as a fake email address in order to trick the recipient into sharing their personal information... information which could then be used to access bank accounts or other personal databases. Even the most professional-looking emails or text messages can be faked, experts warn, so people are encouraged to always act with caution when sharing information on the 'net. All it takes is one mistake... and your information could be out there forever.

DIORAMA_CL_NEWSPAPER_LAKE_CLOSED_BODY=The majority of the scenic and beloved Cauldron Lake area was fenced off and access is restricted as a government agency takes over.<br><br>Tuesday. The unthinkable happened over the weekend as local tourist destination and beloved fishing spot CAULDRON LAKE was cordoned off by government officials. Citing seismic disturbances in the area, the Federal Bureau of Control has limited access for the “forseeable future.” When asked by about the effects this closure will have on the region as a tourist destination, the FBC spokesperson expressed “profound regret on the impact this may or may not have on the local economy.” <br><br>This comes as a shock to locals, who have enjoyed campground and fishing access around the lake for generations. When interviewing residents around town to get a feel for the reception, it was clear that tensions were running high. “This is an absolute outrage,” said Kathy Wahler, lifelong Bright Falls resident and volcanologist. “There has been no documented volcanic activity in this region for millennia. The only seismic activity going on down there is when the Koskelas take their 4x4s for a joy ride on the hiking paths.”<br><br>“I just bought a season camp pass,” said Ed Randall, a Watery native. “I sure hope these Feds reimburse me my $350 bucks, but I’m not holding my breath.” In addition to the inconvenience and anger locals are feeling, there is concern as to what this means for the future. “Joe and Cindy just put all their savings into that convenience store for the campground. What happens to them? What happens to all the businesses around here that rely on out of towners? People are scared, and they want answers.”

DIORAMA_CL_NEWSPAPER_TAKEN_ATTACK_BODY=Rampage at the rental cabins! Unidentified man attacks vacationers in the dead of night<br><br>Sunday. An idyllic evening of barbecuing and late night fishing was violently disrupted Saturday as a mysterious assailant attacked park visitors, causing chaos and distruction at the cabins. The incident left three people injured, one of which has been admitted to the county hospital. As to whether the attacker is still at large, Bright Falls police have yet to make an official statement, leaving local residents in a state of uncertainty.<br><br>Witnesses to the crime were visibly shaken, one of whom stated “One minute we were laughing and toasting some marshmallows, the next we heard screaming coming up from the cabins. We didn’t know what was going on, so we called the police and started running in the opposite direction.” said Kurt Mill.<br><br>Another eye witness who preferred to remain anonymous said, “It’s like he appeared out of nowhere. Suddenly my dog starts barking his head off and this psycho guy comes crashing through the trees... don’t think I’ll ever feel safe in the forest again.”<br><br>A representative from the rental cabins, who chose to remain anonymous, wanted to remind customers “If you have plans to stay in our lovely cabins later this summer, please get in touch with us as we may need to rejigger some of the reservations based on the state of the cabin that you have rented with us.” The representative went on to further remind future and potential guests of the wonderful amenities that can be found in their company’s brochures and on the website, “Which is real nice. State of the art. My nephew made it and he’s a real computer whiz.”

DIORAMA_CL_NOTEBOOK_RANGERS_JOURNAL01_BODY=7-21<br>Tip of the day:<br>When nature calls on a hike, check the direction of the wind before answering.<br><br>Observations:<br>Hikers have broken off branches of some of the trees down by the lake to make an illegal fire. Tried to fix some of the damage - doused the area. Maybe put up more instructional signs?<br><br>I also found some tracks I couldn’t recognize. Pretty big. A wolverine? Or footprints that were smeared? Either way, they were wandering around in strange patterns. Might be a sick animal - will need to keep an eye out.

Some of the saplings I planted earlier are really thriving. Must be all this rain - I don't mind it either. Great sounds to sleep to. It's amazing what a good night's rest and a warm cup of tea can do.

DIORAMA_CL_SIGN_FLORA_FAUNA_BODY=From Alaska to British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and all the way down to California, the Pacific Northwest area spans over a diverse range. Here you will find 59 threatened or endangered species of plants and animals, including the mighty orca and wild gray wolves.<br><br>The Pacific Northwest region’s ecosystems are wonderfully diverse. They include mountain areas like the Cascades and Olympic Ranges as well as the dense forests around them. In the West, there are several islands, and dry desert plateaus cover the East.<br><br>Some of the common wildlife calling the Pacific Northwest their home are robins and seagulls, squirrels and otters, cougars and deer, coyotes and raccoons, salmon and blue herons. The marshes and ponds of this area host an impressive variety of fauna, but majestic trees like the Black Cottonwood, Big Leaf Maple and Oregon Ash thrive in the wetlands too. It is truly the nature lover's paradise.

It hit me suddenly at 1:15am after I'd finished my Ahma on the porch of the trailer. I got in the car and drove, chasing it.<br><br>Starry night, not much moon. As expected, it led me past Bright Falls to Cauldron Lake. I tried to find the right spot, the right emotion, the right thought, the combination to have it all align to make it happen. Terrified it would. It didn't. Not this time. Frustrated but relieved<br><br>I scanned the sky for the shapes, the objects. Nothing. But when I blink repeatedly I think I saw the afterimage of an Octahedron. It faded fast.<br><br>When I got ready to drive back, I felt someone watching me, here but not here. It's him. I know it is! Does he know I'm getting close? I'm on the right track. I was right to come to Bright Falls.

DIORAMA_CL_WILDLIFE_NOTEBOOK_BODY=The Rarest Wildlife in the Pacific Northwest
DIORAMA_CL_WILDLIFE_NOTES01_BODY=I’ve finally made my way to Cauldron Lake. The fence was easy to climb over, with the proper gear and skills which I thankfully possess. Next goal: spotting the rare and elusive orange crowned warbler. A little late in the season, but hopefully I can catch it before it begins its journey south.<br><br>I’ve noticed intriguing behavior in the surrounding common birdlife – they seem to be alarmed and swarm around the lake. No birds of prey nearby. There are some strange sounds carried on the wind, however. Nothing I can recognize or explain. Getting a little concerned. I might have to find another spot, somewhere safer. <br><br>The sounds are getting closer.
DIORAMA_CL_WILDLIFE_NOTES02_BODY=Moved inland. Foliage is STUNNING. Must come back in fall. Had to stop and sketch this gorgeous Vine Maple. Just at the way the Methuselah's Beard hangs off it - this is why trees are better than people.<br><br>Speaking of people, saw some drunk guy staggering around the forest earlier, acting weird - maybe drugs ? Kept my distance. Should probably find another spot. So annoying!
DIORAMA_CL_WILDLIFE_NOTES03_BODY=After I saw that weirdo guy I decided to change spots again - moved up the mountain a bit. Found a fantastic overlook to camp at, but I'm more interested in this Alaska Onion Grass. Invasive but edible and surprisingly tasty!<br><br>Started hearing wolves or wild dogs or something like 10 mins ago... but they sound wrong. Rabies? Want to leave but the sun is going down and my stupid phone is dead. Gonna hide in the tent and hope they go away.<br><br>Something is really not right about this place.
DIORAMA_CL_WITCHLADLE_SIGN_BODY=There is no mystery in Cauldron Lake being named after its cauldron shape. And yet, there are many mysterious stories about the lake. It being a gloomy doorway to the underworld. Or of a witch whose cauldron the lake really was.<br><br>The legend tells that when the affections of a local Sheriff went unanswered, he accused the lady in question of having bewitched him. She was drowned, but her dropped ladle grew into a strange tree, named Witch's Ladle.<br><br>The woman returned to avenge her wrongdoers - if she was not a witch before she was one now. She killed the Sheriff, drowning him in the lake. Then, she took out his heart and locked it in a box. With the heart, she would summon him from the lake to exact revenge on her behalf. Or so the legend goes.

DIORAMA_NR_CL_01_FBC_NOTES_BODY=<b>OBJECTIVE</b>:<br>Research into the reality-altering effects discovered in the Cauldron Lake area utilizing fiction and art as a source, and then manifesting the results into existence.<br><br><b>METHODOLOGY:</b><br>The FBC’s intent in this research project is to experiment with nursery rhymes (hereinafter referred to as "Fiction") in an attempt to recreate the conditions under which the writing would become reality. The hypothesis is that there are two ways in which Fiction affects reality – either by reflecting events that have come to pass but that are not known to their later creator, whose act of creation therefore becomes the catalyst for these past events after which they serve as the source of their own inspiration, or by the Fiction itself being the initiating force in its present timeline, using the creator as a conduit. <br><br> In the experiment, we will create nursery rhyme texts with a specific function, and then use the depicted dolls and symbols as needed via a careful testing process with the purpose of the story told in the Fiction manifesting itself in real life. A variety of combinations involving the dolls, symbols, and rhymes will be tested in order to collect large amounts of data, with the hope that a pattern will appear. Methods will be adjusted in the testing based on our results.

However, I am certain that setting the stage in a sufficiently convincing manner will make the Fiction come into existence. I am now going to use propping in the way a set designer of a feature film would – making the cabin seem like the actual house of the characters depicted in the rhyme with small personal touches and realistic items in addition to the few key items (such as the drawings, dolls, and personal letters) used so far.<br><br>The early results have been promising but incomplete. I will continue with the propping in a controlled manner until it reaches a functional state. It is crucial to gain traction with this. The dimensional opening I’m attempting to manifest in this very location will be a groundbreaking achievement worthy of my genius.

I had the chance to ask Ilmo a few questions about Coffee World.<br><br>Q: Ilmo, what is Coffee World about?<br><br>ILMO: I’m glad you asked! Coffee World is the world’s greatest coffee-themed amusement park for all ages! And right here in our hometown of Watery. It’s got all the rides, thrills, and excitement you could ask for – and of course, lots of delicious, fresh coffee! Both hot and iced. Put that in.<br><br>Q: How did this unique business idea come about?<br><br>ILMO: Well, as you know, I’m all about ideas. An idealist, you could say. But what’s even more important to me than my many successful businesses is our hometown. With my help, we can revitalize Watery, build its economy back up, bring the tourists back in, and enjoy ourselves in the process too! Coffee World is just as much for the townspeople as it is for the out-of-towners.<br><br>Q: Which attraction should the visitors be sure not to miss?<br><br>ILMO: Oh, that’s like having to choose a favorite child. It’s impossible! But the Slow Roaster is of course a wonderful ride full of mystery and magic! And the Espresso Express is sure to give you a thrill! Also, don’t forget to drop by the Fresh Pot Gift Shop on your way out. You never know what treasures you might find!<br><br>Q: Coffee at least, I bet.<br><br>ILMO: Yes.

DIORAMA_RE05_ALTAR_CLIPPING_BADBOY_BODY=Bestselling Author Sets a Feisty New Tone for Writers<br><br>Alan Wake is an author best known for his Alex Casey books, a series of thrilling novels that reinvigorated the crime genre. But Wake isn't just known for his literary works. He's also famous among New York's most exclusive clubs as a late-night party animal. This author is redefining what it means to be a writer. Gone are the days of isolated figures hunching over typewriters in dark rooms. Wake is a man who hits the town in style, a regular at the hottest spots in the city, happy to see and be seen. The people (and the paparazzi) can't get enough of him!<br><br>But it's not just his social calendar that makes this writer stand out from his peers. Artists are famous for their tempers, but Wake's is in a completely different orbit. Damaging property, giving photographers black eyes, avoiding lawsuits, this writer is a train full of rage and you better get off the tracks! Like a punk rocker, Wake is grabbing musty old stereotypes and smashing them to pieces. This is one rebel to keep an eye out for!

DIORAMA_RE05_BASEMENT_ZANE_CLIPPING_BODY=Thomas Zane (born Thomas Seine in Finland) and his partner Barbara Jagger (born Baba Jakala in Finland) have recently established an artist commune here in Bright Falls. Mr. Zane has purchased the old manor house outside town and the couple has already settled in.<br><br>In his home country, and internationally as well, Mr. Zane is a well-known and respected auteur film maker, a rising star already compared to the likes of Stanley Kubrick and Ingmar Bergman. His earlier film “Nightless Night” won a number of European film awards.<br><br>Mr. Zane is currently in the process of filming a feature entitled “Tom the Poet.” In conversation, Mr. Zane comes across as a charismatic figure with big dreams. He talks about building a hotel and a film studio in the area.<br><br>He even has a name picked out for the hotel: “Oceanview Hotel”. This reporter believes the name has a nice ring to it. Mr. Zane’s dreams would certainly make Bright Falls a household name if they became reality. Members of the commune clearly feel the same, seeing Zane as a person worth revering, even to a faintly cult-like degree, a person who guides his flock to expand their consciousness and reach a higher state of artistic inspiration with the aid of “magic” mushrooms. While the Bright Falls Record does not condone the use of illegal drugs, we hope Mr. Zane will help put our town on the artistic map.

Research is ongoing as to the nature of the connection between the Shadow and the psychophysical signatures available for it to mimic. Current hypotheses are:<br><br>a. The Shadow can only manifest as artists, or individuals tangentially involved in the creation of art, who have operated within a certain physical range of Cauldron Lake.<br>b. The Shadow can manifest as any individual “contained” (definition needed) within Cauldron Lake.<br><br>Research is actively ongoing.<br><br>See file 38-453-1873 for full report.<br>

DIORAMA_RE06_CELL_FBC_WAKE_BODY=<b>RE: ALAN WAKE & CULT CONNECTIONS</b><br>SUMMARY:<br>In 2010, writer and suspected parautilitarian Alan Wake was reported to have disappeared into Cauldron Lake, a known Threshold site. Three years later, a small group responsible for multiple killings was arrested in New York City by federal investigators. The murders were re-creations of deaths found in the writing of Alan Wake. Interrogations with the murderers revealed they saw Wake as a sort of prophet, describing themselves as his “cult,” and considered his novels to be sacred texts. As Wake was missing at the time, it’s unlikely he had any personal involvement with this cult, at least there is no evidence supporting the idea.<br><br>Soon after the New York cult was detained, an organization known as the Cult of the Tree began operating around Cauldron Lake, the same area Wake disappeared. This is now the second organization branding themselves as a cult with a direct physical connection to Alan Wake, operating in the location he was last seen in. I propose that this is not a coincidence, and would like permission to search for a link between Wake and the Cult of the Tree.<br><br>See file 14-54-5326 for the full proposal.<br>

DIORAMA_RE10_WAKE_TRANSCRIPT_TITLE=Transcript of interview with subject: ALAN WAKE, suspected parautilitarian
DIORAMA_RS_BF_01_BODY=You are strong!<br>You are successful!<br>You are confident!
DIORAMA_RS_BF_02_BODY=The woods were dark. I held my breath. I could hear heavy footsteps out among the trees. I was scared. My heart beat in my chest like a small bird fluttering against its cage. I shivered. I was cold too.<br><br>I saw a shape emerge from the trees. It was a menacing, large shape. A bad shape. It looked at me with evil, glowing eyes. I gasped. No! It had seen me! It growled and lurched toward me. I ran. I ran and ran and ran until running became too hard to do. I couldn’t run anymore. So I stopped running.<br><br>I could feel the monster’s hot breath on my neck. I was too afraid to turn around. It was about to get me. I was a goner, for sure. I ran again. I had never been so scared, not ever. This was the end. I wished someone, anyone, would come to save me.
DIORAMA_RS_BF_03_BODY=I was going to leave you some cookies but I was worried an animal would get into them, so I didn’t...<br><br>But it’s the thought that counts, right?
DIORAMA_RS_BF_04_BODY=Don’t pretend to be anyone or anything besides who you are!
DIORAMA_RS_BF_05_BODY=Remember that the story won’t let anything bad happen to us!<br><br>Unless it’s good for <b>drama.</b>
DIORAMA_RS_BF_06_BODY=You wouldn’t BELIEVE how hard it was to track down<br>these lunchboxes.<br><br>Thank GOODNESS for the internet!
DIORAMA_RS_BF_07_BODY=Just then, I suddenly slammed into something that felt like a sturdy well-built brick wall. I almost fell, but a strong arm grabbed me by the waist. I hardly knew what was happening. A voice reached through my confused, frightened haze like an outstretched hand. A gruff, manly voice. The deep, reassuring voice reassured me.<br><br>“Don’t you worry, miss. I’ve got this.”<br><br>I looked up just in time to see the monster barreling through the forest at us. Just then, a blast! The monster went down like an elderly person who had lost their cane. I looked up at my savior and saw a handsome face with dark hair. He wore a stylish tweed jacket and held up a smoking pistol.<br><br>“Looks like I got here just in time,” he said. He smiled at me and my heart fluttered like a bird.<br><br>I’ll say, I thought to myself.
DIORAMA_RS_CL_01_BODY=We’re all in this together, hero!<br><br><b>Have a heroic day!</b>
DIORAMA_RS_CL_02_BODY=Obviously you’re going to succeed, or else you wouldn’t be the hero!<br>Duh!
DIORAMA_RS_CL_03_BODY=My dad used to say<br><b>"When the going gets tough, the tough get going."</b><br><br>Not sure where the tough get going to, but maybe you’ll find it inspiring.
DIORAMA_RS_CL_04_BODY=I looked down at the rippling water. The moonlight danced over each and every little wave, a marching band of shimmering light. Lonely and cold, I hugged myself and sighed. I thought of him.<br><br>Then the surface of the lake calmed and, like a spectral surprise, he was there. His face, smiling at me, reflected in the water. I looked up, not daring to believe it was true. But it was true. He was there. My love. My savior. My writer.
DIORAMA_RS_CL_05_BODY=How do you like the knitting, hero?<br><br>I had it made just for you!
DIORAMA_RS_CL_06_BODY=I know things can get a little crazy around here, but if you’re ever feeling scared just remember that ALAN is watching over us.
DIORAMA_RS_CL_08_BODY=His hair was longer than I remembered, blowing gently in the cool night breeze. I put my hand to his cheek, to confirm that he was indeed real. And he was. He was real. Feeling his handsome beard, wild but neatly trimmed, beneath my fingers proved it.<br><br>“You’re back,” I breathed.<br><br>“Yes. I’m back.”<br><br>I wasn’t cold any longer.
DIORAMA_RS_CL_09_BODY=<b>Remember</b> it's just a bad day, not a bad life.<br><br>But if you’re having a good day, ignore this whole thing.
DIORAMA_RS_WA_01_BODY=I lowered my rifle. Standing on the car’s roof, I looked out at the carnage. The zombies had almost won but luckily I was here. Heroes are sometimes the people we least expect them to be. Now my town was finally safe, thanks to me. I slung the hot piece of iron over my shoulder one more time, hopefully for the last time. The townspeople, cautiously emerging from their hiding places, surveyed the same carnage I saw and cheered my name and I waved and they cheered again. Now I could finally get back to my quiet, unassuming life reading books and gardening and fiber crafts and being the world’s top mycology expert.<br><br>Suddenly a hand seized my wrist. I looked into the eyes of the sweet, sensitive writer I had known since childhood. A smile spread across his beautiful kind face and I felt at peace for the first time since the zombies had first emerged.<br><br>“You did it! I knew you could! Now we can live in peace together, for the rest of our days!”
DIORAMA_RS_WA_02_BODY=It must be <b>SO EXCITING</b> to be the story’s hero.<br><br>Honestly, I’m a bit jealous.I wish I could be the protagonist of something.
DIORAMA_RS_WA_03_BODY=Hi, hero. I think a few pieces of paper from my private fanfiction project got mixed into some of these stashes, but I don’t know which ones.<br><br>I posted some online and they’re getting pretty good reviews, but I’d appreciate it if you didn’t read them.<br><br>It’s a privacy thing.
DIORAMA_RS_WA_04_BODY=You can do anything you put your mind to, HERO!<br><br>So long as what you put your mind to is part of the story.
DIORAMA_RS_WA_05_BODY=You can overcome ADVERSITY and achieve your GOALS!
DIORAMA_RS_WA_06_BODY=But then, almost at the same time but not quite, another hand grabbed my other wrist. It was my childhood friend’s estranged twin brother, a rugged ex-soldier who’d helped me fight back the zombie horde, with his chiseled jaw and smoldering eyes and worn leather jacket. My heart fluttered like a small bird against its cage.<br><br>“Ignore him, babe. You know I’m who you want.”<br><br>The sensitive friend I had cared for all my life, or the intense warrior I had known for one harrowing day? How was I ever going to choose? The zombies were easier than this!
DIORAMA_WA_CW_MOOSE_SIGN_MAIN_BODY=One morning during Coffee World's construction, a wounded moose was discovered taking shelter inside the the Fresh Pot Gift Shop. Though limping from a leg injury, the wily moose proved too quick for Wildlife Rescue!<br><br>After a long and unsuccessful chase, everyone stopped for a much needed coffee break - brewing up some of the Coffee World's finest. Before the first cup was poured, the moose appeared, drawn by the delicious aroma. He allowed himself to be treated in exchange for a steaming mug of what is now known as <b>Mocha's Signature Blend</b>.<br><br>Since then, Mocha the Moose has become a beloved fixture of Coffee World, welcoming guests from across the country, as well as personally taste-testing each of our roasts to give them the Mocha seal of approval.

DIORAMA_WA_FOREST_SPOOK_CAMPER_BODY=My first Watery visit.<br><br>I’m staying near the Lighthouse Trailer Park, at a nice little spot just off the road. It’s very quiet here during the day. At night, not so much. I’ve never been too nervous and can sleep through an earthquake, but here…<br><br>I don’t know, something just feels off.<br><br>The animals act weird. They’re restless at night, making weird noises and running away. And I could swear I hear someone moving around, circling.<br><br>I’m going to give it one more night and then move on.

And everything is so fucking great all the time even when it’s in fact the opposite. More than once I’ve thrown up in my mouth during meetings with these movie exec jerks.<br><br>But I gotta be here to look after Al’s legacy. Everyone wants to gobble up the film rights for the Casey books, and they have moronic ideas of what to do with them. It’s my duty to herd this horde of tanned zombies into the general direction of something resembling good taste. I’m painfully aware how deeply Al would have hated adaptations if they didn’t do justice to his vision. He was a master of hating things deeply. For good reasons. I mean, that’s why we loved him so much, right?<br><br>Anyway, gotta hop on another video call now to talk about casting. <br><br>Your Pal, Barry

Blessed Wellness Retreat.<br><br>Working with Al or the Andersons was tough sometimes, but these movie biz types are INSANE! My stress levels were through the roof, but then I was tipped off about the retreat. The best decision I ever made. I have never felt this good and, well, healthy. The guy who runs this place, Chester, is a god damn miracle worker. Not a wacko in any way.<br><br>I know you think I’m full of shit, but I have lost a ton of weight, you wouldn’t recognize me. Chester says I’m lucky to have ended up here, that something bad would have happened to me if I’d stayed in New York. I believe him. I wasn’t feeling great after everything that happened, especially after those FBC creepos wanted to chat with me. Enough to turn anyone into a conspiracy nut.<br><br>I hope you are good over there, come visit anytime. West Coast is not as bad as I made it sound in my earlier mails.<br>Your pal, Barry

This is for YOUR BENEFIT, so take it seriously.<br><br>The community-voted dunk tank victim this year will be... drumroll please... DEPUTY THORNTON. Congratulations! Looks like everyone’s getting retribution for that speed trap on 12C at last, eh?<br><br>A friendly reminder that anyone out sick on the day needs to provide a written doctor's note, or you'll be assigned night shift for two weeks.

FACT__ANDERSON_NAME__ANDERSON_NAME=Not exactly an uncommon surname, though.
FACT__ANIMAL_PEOPLE_NOTE__ANIMAL_PEOPLE_NOTE=Dehumanizing their victims. They are the predators, their victims are just prey.
FACT__BAREFOOT_TRACKS__BAREFOOT_TRACKS=What? He walked through a boulder? Doesn't make sense.
FACT__BEAR__BEAR=What a little cutie. So well painted, too.
FACT__BF_01__BF_01=What are these? Affirmations...?
FACT__BF_01__FOUND=Hiding in plain sight, surrounded by those twig triangles, too.
FACT__BF_02__BF_02_A=There was the page of a story inside, but... this is definitely not like the other pages I've been finding. Fanfiction?
FACT__BF_02__BF_02_B=Another piece of fanfiction. Wonder where this is going...
FACT__BF_02__COMPLETED=By trying to protect against one danger, she exposed her child to another danger.
FACT__BF_02__FOUND=This Cult stash was in the street. Literally just out in the street.
FACT__BF_03__BF_03=Cookies? Who is is this supposed to be for...?
FACT__BF_03__COMPLETED=I'm not loving the depiction of the mom as "a horrible beast with a pointy nose." Kids can be cruel, I guess.
FACT__BF_03__FOUND=Pretty menacing note inside.
FACT__BF_04__BF_04_A=There was the page of a story inside, but... this is definitely not like the other pages I've been finding. Fanfiction?
FACT__BF_04__BF_04_B=Looks like another piece of fanfiction. Someone is having some vivid fantasies.
FACT__BF_04__COMPLETED=A cautionary rhyme about a child who fell out of a boat and drowned.
FACT__BF_04__FOUND=Who is this note for, exactly? Did the Cult expect someone to break inside?
FACT__BF_05__BF_05_A=The note inside  mentions the "story." Is this person aware of the horror story, too?
FACT__BF_05__BF_05_B=Another mention of the "story." Whoever this is, they seem aware of Wake's horror story...
FACT__BF_05__COMPLETED=Is the moral of the story here to feed anyone who rings your doorbell? This was very odd.
FACT__BF_05__FOUND=Note inside this one talked about going "bigger." Wonder what they mean.
FACT__BF_06__BF_06=This was just left out in the park, for anyone to find.
FACT__BF_06__FOUND=A stash INSIDE the station? Is law enforcement involved...? Who can I trust?
FACT__BF_07__BF_07_A=There was the page of a story inside, but... this is definitely not like the other pages I've been finding. Fanfiction?
FACT__BF_07__BF_07_B=Our fanfiction writer has an extremely active imagination.
FACT__BF_07__FOUND=The puzzle to open this one felt a little silly. Strange, for a Cult.
FACT__BF_08__FOUND=The note inside is pretty menacing.
FACT__BF_09__FOUND=The note inside makes it sound like Wake is their next target.
FACT__BIKER_GARAGE__BIKER_GARAGE=The photo was taken at the Kalevala Knights motorcycle club. Are they involved in the Cult? More importantly, is the Clicker still there...?
FACT__BIRDS_RHYMES__BIRDS_RHYMES=Seems to be left by the author of the rhymes. Workshopping the style.
FACT__BIRTHDAY_CARD__BIRTHDAY_CARD=I don't recognize the card, but that's definitely Mom's handwriting.
FACT__BLOATED_BODY__BLOATED_BODY=Victim was alive when strapped down. Timeline is inconsistent with bloating.
FACT__BLOODY_BANDAGE__BLOODY_BANDAGE=Why remove a bandage when you're still bleeding...?
FACT__BLUM_CULT_STUFF__BLUM_CULT_STUFF=That's some pretty damning evidence. Blum is a member.
FACT__BLUM_CULT_STUFF__BLUM_CULT_STUFF_B=The letter looks new. Seems like he was recruited recently.
FACT__BLUM_EMAIL__BLUM_EMAIL=Looks like the Cult was leaning heavily on Blum to recruit Tor and Odin.
FACT__BLUM_ILMO_OWNS_TRAILER__BLUM_ILMO_OWNS_TRAILER=Blum mentioned Ilmo Koskela owns a trailer park. Ilmo can tell me more.
FACT__BLUM_NOTEBOOK__BLUM_NOTEBOOK=He sounds excited. Wonder what he was planning...
FACT__BODY_ALTERATIONS__BODY_ALTERATIONS=Victim #3 was covered in illegible tattoos. A message from the killer maybe? Or their "art"?
FACT__BODY_BLOAT__BODY_BLOAT=Bloating of the corpse is indicative of drowning, but only one victim was found in water.
FACT__BODY_BUTCHERED__BODY_BUTCHERED=Killer may be a sportsman or hunter.
FACT__BODY_OF_VICTIM__BODY_OF_VICTIM=Another body has been found in the woods near Bright Falls. Perfect timing. Need to see if this is linked to the killings we're here to investigate.
FACT__BON_POSTER__BON_POSTER=Logan loves BON. I took her to a concert in DC for her 12th birthday. This isn't fake.
FACT__BOOKERS_CLOTHING__BOOKERS_CLOTHING=Multiple assailants chanting with a matching dress code? We're not dealing with a serial killer.
FACT__BRIGHT_FALLS_TEST_SITE__BRIGHT_FALLS_TEST_SITE=The locations are Rangers Station, Bunker Woods, and Boatyard. 
FACT__BROKEN_RECORD__BROKEN_RECORD=The missing record is one-of-a-kind. The rest are all popular releases.
FACT__CALENDAR__CALENDAR=Dates are common passwords. Might be something here.
FACT__CALL_CUT_OFF__CALL_CUT_OFF=What happened to Tor? I heard yelling before the call was cut off.
FACT__CARGO_STRAPS__CARGO_STRAPS=Bruising indicates victim was alive when restrained. Matches other cases.
FACT__CASEY_AFRAID_ALONE__CASEY_AFRAID_ALONE=YOU KNEW HE WAS INJURED. WHY THE HELL DID YOU TAKE HIM TO CAULDRON LAKE?
FACT__CASEY_BACKUP__CASEY_BACKUP=YOU WERE SO EAGER TO BE IN CHARGE THAT YOU LEFT HIM BEHIND
FACT__CASEY_CULT_MONSTERS__CASEY_CULT_MONSTERS=I don't have an explanation for this... How are they doing this? What the hell is going on here?
FACT__CASEY_HAPPY_MEMORY__CASEY_HAPPY_MEMORY=Casey never jokes around with anyone else. He respects and trusts me.
FACT__CASEY_IS_SCRATCH__CASEY_IS_SCRATCH=CASEY IS GONE AND IT'S YOUR FUCKING FAULT
FACT__CASEY_NIGHTINGALE_ID__CASEY_NIGHTINGALE_ID=I trust Casey's read on people. Sounds like our victim wasn't mentally stable.
FACT__CASEY_NOT_REAL__CASEY_NOT_REAL=YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO CAULDRON LAKE RIGHT TO SCRATCH
FACT__CASEY_NOT_WAKE__CASEY_NOT_WAKE=Casey thinks Wake is Scratch, and always has been. Certainly possible.
FACT__CASEY_POS_GOOD_PARTNER__CASEY_POS_GOOD_PARTNER=Casey isn't just a partner. He's family.
FACT__CASEY_POS_INJURY__CASEY_POS_INJURY=Casey has never blamed me when things go sideways. It's all part of the job.

FACT__CASEY__CASEY=CASEY IS A MONSTER NOW
FACT__CASE_CLOSED_CL_MURDER__CASE_CLOSED_CL_MURDER=I killed Nightingale. I had to. He was a monster. The flooding around Cauldron Lake receded afterward. Nothing about this makes rational sense. We found Alan Wake, a writer missing for 13 years,  at the shore of the lake. Hopefully he can shed some light on this...
FACT__CASE_CLOSED_CS__CASE_CLOSED_CS=I think I've finally found all the cult stashes in the area. Sure were a lot of these scattered around.
FACT__CASE_CLOSED_CULT_TREE__CASE_CLOSED_CULT_TREE=The Cult of the Tree was being run by the Koskela brothers. They served as a sort of "neighborhood watch" against the Taken. Not the bad guys here.
FACT__CASE_CLOSED_CULT__CASE_CLOSED_CULT=I need to get the Clicker to Wake, but I still have questions. Those old guys - Tor and Odin - seemed friendly with the Cult. How are they connected to all this?
FACT__CASE_CLOSED_FAMILY__CASE_CLOSED_FAMILY=Wake's story created surreal and disturbing alternate life for me. But it also revealed something: I DO have roots in this town.
FACT__CASE_CLOSED_MIND_PLACE__CASE_CLOSED_MIND_PLACE=The Dark Place tried to weaponize my anxieties against me. I won't let it turn me into a Taken. I'm stronger than that, and Logan needs me.
FACT__CASE_CLOSED_NR__CASE_CLOSED_NR=An FBC researcher was working with nursery rhymes to create a gateway to the Dark Place. The experiment was a success, but not the way he'd hoped.
FACT__CASE_CLOSED_PREV_MURDERS__CASE_CLOSED_PREV_MURDERS=Not a lone killer, but an organized group: "The Cult of the Tree." This case just got much more interesting. I should open a new file, start fresh.
FACT__CASE_CLOSED_RESCUE_WAKE__CASE_CLOSED_RESCUE_WAKE=Tor and Odin played their song. Everything was going to plan, until the Dark Presence went into Casey and took the Clicker...
FACT__CASE_CLOSED_RETURN__CASE_CLOSED_RETURN=I feel like I could spend a lifetime trying to understand all of this and still have questions. Even so, I feel like I'm grasping how all this works a bit better now.
FACT__CASE_CLOSED_TOR__CASE_CLOSED_TOR=I rescued Tor Anderson - my grandfather - from the Dark Presence. Wake fucking wrote Logan into this story. She's in danger because of him. Within Scratch's reach. I need Wake to write an ending that will save her.
FACT__CASSETTE_CW_LOCATION__CASSETTE_CW_LOCATION=The cassette tape is at the "Fair Trade Fun Zone"
FACT__CASSETTE_FLOAT__CASSETTE_FLOAT=Seems like there should be some kind of audio effects coming from the well.

FACT__CCTV_TOR_DESTROY__CCTV_TOR_DESTROY=It looks like he's fighting with nothing. Or maybe with himself...?
FACT__CHARACTER__CHARACTER=THE STORY IS A DELUSION YOU INVENTED TO HIDE FROM THE TRUTH
FACT__CHARM__CHARM=A charm appeared. Where did it come from? I wonder if there are others...
FACT__CHEST_MANUSCRIPT__CHEST_MANUSCRIPT=A page where his heart should be. Text tattooed on the missing heart. Can't be a coincidence.
FACT__CHEST_TRAUMA__CHEST_TRAUMA=Most recent victim died of major chest trauma. Consistent with 2018 victim? Hard to confirm due to condition of body.
FACT__CHEST_WOUND__CHEST_WOUND=As I suspected, it looks like something was put in there.
FACT__CHILD__CHILD=Cute. I like the braids.
FACT__CIRCUIT_CW_LOCATION__CIRCUIT_CW_LOCATION=The circuit board is at the "Espresso Express."
FACT__CIRCUIT_FLOAT__CIRCUIT_FLOAT="Again and again?" Sounds like he's supposed to be moving.
FACT__CLICKER_DISAPPEAR__CLICKER_DISAPPEAR=I was so damn close. Mulligan and Thornton took it.
FACT__CLICKER_EMAIL__CLICKER_EMAIL=What the hell is an "OOP"? Is it connected to the Clicker?
FACT__CLICKER_GONE__CLICKER_GONE=The Dark Presence took Casey. Casey is Scratch now. And he has the Clicker.
FACT__CLIPPING__CLIPPING=Nope.

FACT__CL_03__CL_03=The writer of the note is leaving these to inspire someone. Are the really for me?

FACT__CL_03__FOUND=There is a note inside encouraging Cultists to dehumanize their victims.
FACT__CL_04__CL_04_A=There was the page of a story inside, but... this is definitely not like the other pages I've been finding. Fanfiction?
FACT__CL_04__CL_04_B=This fanfiction seems to be fairly... personal.
FACT__CL_04__COMPLETED=In the rhyme the hero was aided by two crows. They shared the reward together.
FACT__CL_04__FOUND=The Cult stash has an ominous, creepy warning note inside.
FACT__CL_05__CL_05=The note inside mentions making knitting just for me. How do they know I knit? Or maybe just a coincidence?
FACT__CL_05__COMPLETED=A rhyme about a reckless hero, being watched over by "the far away Father."
FACT__CL_05__FOUND=Is the note inside to scare people off? Do they expect people to break into these?
FACT__CL_06__CL_06=The note inside mentions "Alan." Alan Wake? What the hell are these?
FACT__CL_06__FOUND=This was just sitting in a random bathroom. Pretty random.
FACT__CL_08__CL_08_A=There was the page of a story inside, but... this is definitely not like the other pages I've been finding. Fanfiction?
FACT__CL_08__CL_08_B=Another piece of fanfiction. Whoever's writing these is obviously having a good time.
FACT__CL_09__CL_09=You know, I kind of needed to hear this. Thanks, lunchbox writer.
FACT__COFFEE_BAG_STICKERS__COFFEE_BAG_STICKERS=The stickers are next to the photos on the staff board.
FACT__COMPUTER__COMPUTER=The computer must unlock the door, if I can figure out the password to get in.
FACT__CRIMESCENE_FOOTSTEP__CRIMESCENE_FOOTSTEP=These footprints weren't here before. Nightingale came this way. I'm on the right trail.
FACT__CROW__CROW=Kind of reads more like an owl to me.
FACT__CULT_CLICKER_DISCOVER__CULT_CLICKER_DISCOVER_1=The cultists knew the Clicker had power. They found it at at Cauldron Lake lake.
FACT__CULT_CLICKER_DISCOVER__CULT_CLICKER_DISCOVER_2=How did they figure out how to use it? Trial and error...?
FACT__CULT_EMAIL_BLUM__CULT_EMAIL_BLUM=By the looks of this, Blum is definitely a Cult member.
FACT__CULT_EMAIL_BLUM__CULT_EMAIL_BLUM_B=Working at the nursing home, Blum would be well positioned to recruit the Andersons...
FACT__CULT_INITIATION_LETTER__CULT_INITIATION_LETTER=Blum recently joined the Cult. Is anyone here NOT a damn cultist?
FACT__CULT_LOGO__CULT_LOGO=Seriously? This would almost be funny if they weren't killing people.
FACT__CULT_NECKLACE__CULT_NECKLACE=Jewelry can be used as a subtle indicator of membership. But this isn't subtle - a badge of pride?
FACT__CULT_NOTE_CLICKER__CULT_NOTE_CLICKER_1=The cultists knew the Clicker had power. They found it at at the lake.
FACT__CULT_NOTE_CLICKER__CULT_NOTE_CLICKER_2=How did they figure out how to use it? Trial and error...?
FACT__CULT_NOTE_WAKE__CULT_NOTE_WAKE=The Cult knows Wake is here. And they clearly aren't fans of his.
FACT__CULT_STASH__MAIN=I found a hidden cultist stash. I should keep an eye out for more of these things.
FACT__CYNTHIA_BATH_TUB__CYNTHIA_BATH_TUB=Cynthia hid the record in her bathtub. It better still work...
FACT__CYNTHIA_DIARY__CYNTHIA_DIARY=Cynthia's fears made her vulnerable. That's how she became a Taken.
FACT__CYNTHIA_SEDUCE_TOR__CYNTHIA_SEDUCE_TOR=Need to find out where Cynthia hid the record.
FACT__DARK_PRESENCE__DARK_PRESENCE=According to Wake, the Dark Presence can sometimes take his appearance. How? Why?
FACT__DARK_SUBSTANCE__DARK_SUBSTANCE=It looks like a trail, does it want me to follow?
FACT__DEERFEST_MASKS__DEERFEST_MASKS=If they're hiding their faces, they aren't established enough to operate openly. Connection to Deerfest?
FACT__DEER__DEER=Kind of hard to tell it's a deer. I suppose clothespins are a limiting medium...
FACT__DROWNED__DROWNED=YOU COULDN'T FACE WHAT HAPPENED, SO YOU CRACKED
FACT__EMAIL_INFRASTRUCTURE__EMAIL_INFRASTRUCTURE=With an electronic system like this, you'd think they'd at least have a backup generator. Oh well.
FACT__EMAIL_RHYME_AUTHOR__EMAIL_RHYME_AUTHOR="Parafictional research?" Who is funding these people...?
FACT__EMPLOYEE_LOG_BOARD__EMPLOYEE_LOG_BOARD=Percolator...? The name of a ride, maybe?
FACT__EMPTY_ALTAR__EMPTY_ALTAR=This is the Cult of the Tree's headquarters.
FACT__EMPTY_TOR_BEDROOM__1=Tor wasn't in his room, but the place is a mess. Odin mentioned the Wellness Center, I should check there.

FACT__ESTEVEZ_NEED_POWER__ESTEVEZ_NEED_POWER=Time to fix another fucking power outage. 
FACT__ESTEVEZ_OBJECT_POWER__ESTEVEZ_OBJECT_POWER=The FBC is confident the Clicker has power. But can that power help us? Or just Scratch?

FACT__EXTERNAL_EXAMINATION__EXTERNAL_EXAMINATION=Body has been prepped, ready for examination. Hope it can provide some actual answers.
FACT__FALSE_MEMORIES__FALSE_MEMORIES=According to Wake, the story is changing people's memories. That's why they think they know me. But I'm not a character, I'm real. Need to track what's part of the story and what isn't.
FACT__FATHER__FATHER=The glasses are a nice touch.
FACT__FBC_BARBARA__CASEY_NOT_WAKE=So, this isn't the first time the Dark Presence has stolen someone's form.

FACT__FBC_CAULDRON_LAKE__FBC_CAULDRON_LAKE=Wake's in the Dark Place, and Cauldron Lake is the threshold to it.
FACT__FBC_CLICKER_FILE__FBC_CLICKER_FILE=The FBC speculates that the Clicker can only be used by a "capable parautilitarian."
FACT__FBC_CULT_OF_TREE__FBC_CULT_OF_TREE=It's possible Wake is connected to the Cult. But if Scratch is identical to Wake, then this could refer to either of them.
FACT__FBC_CULT_SABOTAGE__FBC_CULT_SABOTAGE=Seems our cultists aren't totally aligned, here. Don't sound like the "true believer" types.
FACT__FBC_EMAILS_MAIDEN_WAITING__FBC_EMAILS_MAIDEN_WAITING=The emails indicate the FBC is authoring these rhymes. But why?
FACT__FBC_LIGHT_ARRAY__FBC_LIGHT_ARRAY=Looks like the FBC is also aware of the Dark Presence's weakness.

FACT__FBC_NURSERY_RHYMES__FBC_NURSERY_RHYMES=So, the FBC is researching how fiction affects reality. Sounds familiar.
FACT__FBC_RESEARCHER__FBC_RESEARCHER=That asshole tried to trick me into the Dark Place. Joke's on him, I guess.
FACT__FBC_SHADOW__FBC_SHADOW=Was Jagger trapped in Cauldron Lake the same way as Wake?
FACT__FEED_ON_ART__FEED_ON_ART=It's not just writing. Music, painting, film, photography - any artistic expression can feed it.
FACT__FIND_TOR__FIND_TOR=Is Tor turning into a Taken? Odin asked me to help him, but what's really going on here?
FACT__FINISH_RS__FINISH_RS=Rose was leaving the lunch boxes. She was using them to fight Taken, but also hoped the Hero of Wake's story would find the supplies useful.
FACT__FIRST_RHYME_SOLVED__FIRST_RHYME_SOLVED=Completing the puzzle made the world change? What's going on here?
FACT__FIRST_RHYME__FIRST_RHYME=What is this setup? Why the tripod? Some kind of experiment?

FACT__FOUND_HEART_FRIDGE__FOUND_HEART_FRIDGE=How did this get here from the morgue...? Did Nightingale hide it here?
FACT__FOUND_HEART__FOUND_HEART=Heart was removed, but then left on the table near the body. Was this murder interrupted...?
FACT__FREYA_FAMILY__FREYA_FAMILY=Anytime I asked Mom about her home or family, she shut down. I have no idea who my grandparents are.
FACT__FREYA_PICTURE__FREYA_PICTURE=This looks exactly like Mom. And that's me. Is this still part of the story?
FACT__GIFT_SHOP_LOCKED__GIFT_SHOP_LOCKED=Ilmo said someone would help me, but there's no one here. Looks like I'll need to find my own way inside...
FACT__GIFT_SHOP__GIFT_SHOP=Coffee World is certainly... interesting. And empty. Ilmo said someone would help me get the key, but nobody's here.
FACT__HEART_REMOVED__HEART_REMOVED=This is consistent with previous killings.
FACT__HERO__HERO=Is that foil lining? Someone put in a lot of effort.
FACT__HOW_MIND_PLACE_WORKS__HOW_MIND_PLACE_WORKS=They know more about the Mind Place than I do. They know ME.
FACT__ICE_COOLER__ICE_COOLER=Staking out this spot. Having a cold one while they waited for our victim?
FACT__ILMO_ATTACKED_WAKE__ILMO_ATTACKED_WAKE=I saw him with my own two eyes. No doubt Ilmo is in the Cult. But what about Jaakko?
FACT__ILMO_HAS_TRAILER_KEY__ILMO_HAS_TRAILER_KEY=Ilmo said someone at "Coffee World" could help me.
FACT__ILMO_KILLING_TAKEN__ILMO_KILLING_TAKEN=The Cult's intentions were good, even if they weren't seeing the full picture.
FACT__ILMO_MASK__ILMO_MASK=Mulligan and Thornton screwed something up. Something to do with the skull.
FACT__ILMO_NIGHINGALE__ILMO_NIGHINGALE=Nightingale's ritual was the only one interrupted. That's why he was the only Taken among the cult victims.
FACT__ILMO_NOT_SCRATCH__ILMO_NOT_SCRATCH=Doesn't seem like the Cult has any connection to Scratch.
FACT__ILMO_OWNS_TRAILER__ILMO_OWNS_TRAILER=Well, that worked out. Let's see what he knows.
FACT__ILMO_PASSCODE_HINT__ILMO_PASSCODE_HINT=The answer is somewhere in the gift shop...
FACT__ILMO_PASSCODE_NOTE__ILMO_PASSCODE_NOTE=The note mentions three jobs: tracker, lookout, and cleaner.
FACT__ILMO_SAGAS_TRAILER__ILMO_SAGAS_TRAILER=They really think I lived here. This is unnerving... but at least I can exploit it to get inside this trailer.
FACT__ILMO_SAGA_RESIDENT__ILMO_SAGA_RESIDENT=Finally someone appreciates my jokes. But seriously, what kind of life did I live here?
FACT__INITIATION_LETTER__INITIATION_LETTER=Well I could've guessed they'd both be in on it, but here's the proof Jaakko is involved too.
FACT__INTERRUPTED_RITUAL__INTERRUPTED_RITUAL=This confirms the ritual was interrupted. It says they didn't have time to use the Clicker.
FACT__JAAKKO__JAAKKO=WHAT KIND OF DETECTIVE ARE YOU? THEY WERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
FACT__JOKE_BOOK__JOKE_BOOK=Looks like it was a present... Were we close?
FACT__JUNIOR_DETECTIVE__JUNIOR_DETECTIVE=I remember this - It was Take Your Daughter to Work Day. Logan was maybe... eight? This happened.
FACT__LETTER_FROM_CASEY__LETTER_FROM_CASEY=In the story I took a leave of absence from the Bureau.
FACT__LIGHT_TRIPOD__LIGHT_TRIPOD=Looks new. Brought by the killers. Why? To mount a camera? Weird snuff film...?
FACT__LIGHT__LIGHT=It would make sense that light is effective against the Dark Presence, too.
FACT__LOGANS_THINGS__LOGANS_THINGS=Maybe Wake can't invent wholly new ideas. Has to use what already exists?
FACT__LOGAN_ARE_YOU_A_MOTHER__LOGAN_ARE_YOU_A_MOTHER=SHE DIED ALONE AND SCARED BEGGING YOU FOR HELP AND YOU WEREN'T THERE
FACT__LOGAN_DAVID_LEFT_YOU__LOGAN_DAVID_LEFT_YOU=YOU TOOK HER FROM DAVID AND STUCK HER IN A BACKWATER SHIT HOLE
FACT__LOGAN_DIED_SCREAMING__LOGAN_DIED_SCREAMING=IF YOU HADN'T BEEN AT WORK, SHE'D STILL BE ALIVE 
FACT__LOGAN_DRAWINGS__LOGAN_DRAWINGS=These drawings look like those guys I met outside - Tor and Odin.
FACT__LOGAN_HAPPY_MEMORY__LOGAN_HAPPY_MEMORY=She wanted us to stay connected. God, I love that kid.
FACT__LOGAN_IS_DEAD_E__LOGAN_IS_DEAD_E=AS THE WATER FILLED HER LUNGS SHE REALIZED YOU WEREN'T COMING
FACT__LOGAN_IS_DEAD_F__LOGAN_IS_DEAD_F=CAN YOU EVEN STILL CALL YOURSELF A MOTHER AFTER YOU LET YOUR ONLY CHILD DIE?
FACT__LOGAN_IS_DEAD_G__LOGAN_IS_DEAD_G=YOU'RE BLAMING A HORROR STORY INSTEAD OF YOURSELF YOU COWARD ADMIT SHE'S DEAD AND YOU KILLED HER YOU KILLED HER YOU KILLED HER
FACT__LOGAN_LONELY__LOGAN_LONELY=SHE SPENT EVERY DAY BY HERSELF IN THAT TRAILER
FACT__LOGAN_NEGLECTED_FAMILY__LOGAN_NEGLECTED_FAMILY=YOU WERE NEVER HOME  THERE WAS ALWAYS MORE WORK MORE CASES YOU TOLD YOURSELF IT WAS IMPORTANT
FACT__LOGAN_NOT_DEAD__LOGAN_NOT_DEAD=No. This is just the story trying to hurt me. It's not real.
FACT__LOGAN_OCCAMS_RAZOR__LOGAN_OCCAMS_RAZOR=WHAT MAKES MORE SENSE: EVERYONE IS WRONG? OR YOU ARE?
FACT__LOGAN_POS_MOM_MUG__LOGAN_POS_MOM_MUG=I've brought this mug with me on every case. I go where work takes me, but I never forget where home is.
FACT__LOGAN_STOP_DENYING_IT__LOGAN_STOP_DENYING_IT=YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO WON'T ACCEPT SHE'S DEAD
FACT__LOGAN__LOGAN=SHE'S DEAD BECAUSE OF YOU
FACT__LOST_IT__LOST_IT=SHADOW MONSTERS? FALSE REALITIES? MAGICAL WRITERS? REALLY?
FACT__MAIDEN__MAIDEN=It's got a little bag. For all its maidenly needs.
FACT__MANDY_KNITTING__MANDY_KNITTING=She mentioned she's been making them for Rose. Hmm.
FACT__MANUSCRIPT_PAGE__MANUSCRIPT_PAGE=THE PAGES WERE YOUR EXCUSE FOR ALWAYS BEING ONE STEP BEHIND
FACT__MASK_CW_LOCATION__MASK_CW_LOCATION=Why scratch it out? Maybe someone doesn't want me to find this thing...
FACT__MASK_FLOAT__MASK_FLOAT=It says "MASK" where the face should be.
FACT__MASK_WELL__MASK_WELL=Those monsters stashed the skull the same place they hid their victim. Not very original.
FACT__MEMORIES_CHANGE__MEMORIES_CHANGE=It's not just Rose - Ilmo and Jaakko are affected, too. How long before my memories are affected?
FACT__MONSTER__MONSTER=A monster with long blonde hair. I like it.
FACT__MOOSE__MOOSE=I love the antlers and its little face, nicely made.
FACT__MOTHER__MOTHER=Holding the belly. A bit on the nose for my taste.
FACT__MOTORCYCLE_CLUB__MOTORCYCLE_CLUB=Highly unlikely the club would have a secret Cult room below it without the Koskelas knowing.
FACT__MP_CLICKER_WATERY__MP_CLICKER_WATERY=A trailer near Watery, huh? Good place to start.
FACT__MP_CYNTHIA_TOR__MP_CYNTHIA_TOR=Cynthia is doing all this for "Tom". Another one of the Dark Presence's masks...?
FACT__MP_OVERLAP__MP_OVERLAP=The "Overlap?" What? These pages aren't making sense.
FACT__MP_PAGE_ROCK__MP_PAGE_ROCK=So the killer is watching us? Game on.
FACT__MP_STACK_OVERLAP__MP_STACK_OVERLAP=According to the page, it sounds like Nightingale went back to Cauldron Lake. And he's a "Taken"...?
FACT__MP_TORS_CONDITION__MP_TORS_CONDITION=Doesn't sound like he's becoming a Taken. More like he's being manipulated somehow.
FACT__MP_WLROCK_FUSE__MP_WLROCK_FUSE=I think the page is trying to tell me where to find the fuse. It must be somewhere near the Witch's Hut.
FACT__MP_WLROCK_LIT__MP_WLROCK_LIT=Is this implying light can affect reality? Nightingale WAS chased off by my flashlight...
FACT__MT_CULTISTS__MT_CULTISTS=The page describes Mulligan and Thornton as members of the Cult of the Tree.
FACT__MT_CULTIST_NOTE__MT_CULTIST_NOTE=M and T COULD stand for Mulligan and Thornton...
FACT__MT_MASK_WELL__MT_MASK_WELL=They hid their victim's body in a well. Maybe that's not the only thing they hid...
FACT__NAME_PATTERN__NAME_PATTERN=Could be a coincidence. A pretty big one, but... hm.
FACT__NIGHTINGALE_BACK_TO_LIFE__NIGHTINGALE_BACK_TO_LIFE=Nightingale attacked us. A CORPSE attacked us. I used his sensitivity to light to fight him off, but he got away. I need to hunt him down and figure out what the fuck is going on here.
FACT__NIGHTINGALE_COLD__NIGHTINGALE_COLD=I can feel that Nightingale came from the lake. But why now, after 13 years? Where's he been?
FACT__NIGHTINGALE_CRIMESCENE__NIGHTINGALE_CRIMESCENE="The tree" could mean Witch's Ladle, but what's it a threshold to? The Overlap?
FACT__NIGHTINGALE_HEART__NIGHTINGALE_HEART=I think I walked by an abandoned general store near the murder site.
FACT__NIGHTINGALE_MANUSCRIPT_PAGE__NIGHTINGALE_MANUSCRIPT_PAGE=There's more going on here than I'm seeing. I need to examine this body properly back in town.
FACT__NIGHTINGALE_ONLY_TAKEN__NIGHTINGALE_ONLY_TAKEN=His murder matched the other victims - why didn't they become monsters, too?
FACT__NIGHTINGALE_TAKEN__NIGHTINGALE_TAKEN=I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. Need to dig into this, there must be an explanation.
FACT__NORMAN_ODIN_UPSTAIRS__NORMAN_ODIN_UPSTAIRS=Maybe Odin can tell me what happened to Tor.
FACT__NORSE_BOOK__NORSE_BOOK=Mom gave to this Logan when she was a baby. The stories are a bit scary but she loved the pictures. This is real.
FACT__NOTE_REWARD__NOTE_REWARD=The Cult was really serious about recruiting Tor and Odin.
FACT__NOT_CONNECTED__NOT_CONNECTED=Apart from going missing in 2010, the victims have nothing apparent in common.
FACT__NO_WRITING_RITUAL__NO_WRITING_RITUAL=Tattooing isn't listed as part of the ritual either. So the Cult has no connection with the writing.
FACT__NURSERY_RHYMES__DOLL=These mysterious rhymes are scattered around the area. Why are they out here? Who is making them?
FACT__ODIN_CLICKER_1__ODIN_CLICKER_1=This is why Wake needs the Clicker. Can he be trusted with the power to change reality? Can anyone?
FACT__ODIN_CLICKER_2__ODIN_CLICKER_2=The Clicker needs to be used with Wake's writing. Does it really have the power to fix this?
FACT__ODIN_CLICKER__ODIN_CLICKER=So Wake writes a story, the Dark Place makes it change reality, and the Clicker amplifies that change, making it permanent. Makes... sense?
FACT__ODIN_FAMILY__ODIN_FAMILY=So the story is giving me wacky relatives now? Still, there's something off about these guys...
FACT__ODIN_FREYA_LEFT__ODIN_FREYA_LEFT=From the few things Mom said, this is actually plausible. Is it really true? What did Tor do to make Mom leave?
FACT__ODIN_MIND_PLACE__ODIN_MIND_PLACE=It felt different. Clearer. Like a conversation. What does this mean? He called me a "seer." 
FACT__ODIN_TOR_TOOK_RECORD__ODIN_TOR_TOOK_RECORD=If Tor gave the record to Cynthia, she's the only one who can tell me where it is.
FACT__ODIN_TOR_WELLNESS_CENTER__1=Odin seems really worried about his brother. I should see if Tor's in his room.
FACT__ODIN_TOR_WELLNESS_CENTER__2=Hm. Tor wasn't in his room, but it sounds like I should check out the Wellness Center. 
FACT__ODIN_WHERE_IS_SONG__ODIN_WHERE_IS_SONG=They kept the record in the museum. Must have been important to them.
FACT__OTHER_WOUNDS__OTHER_WOUNDS=Looks like Nightingale put up a fight before they restrained him.
FACT__OVERLAP_FLOAT__OVERLAP_FLOAT=The float was about a murder. The specific content of the art seems significant.
FACT__OVERLAP_FLOODING__OVERLAP_FLOODING=Does the Overlap cause the flooding...? 
FACT__OVERLAP_POEM__OVERLAP_POEM=The poem was about a local legend - a witch's lost heart. About terror.
FACT__OVERLAP_SONG__OVERLAP_SONG=The theme of the song was regret - remorse for how Tor treated my mother.
FACT__OVERLAP__OVERLAP=Tor is here somewhere - I need to find him and get him out.
FACT__PAGE_CLICKER__PAGE_CLICKER=Scratch just needs the Clicker to make his ending into reality. Can't let that happen.
FACT__PAGE_CULT_GATHERING__PAGE_CULT_GATHERING="Grandmaster...?" Interesting word to use, under the circumstances.
FACT__PAGE_CYNTHIA__PAGE_CYNTHIA=Cynthia had an unrequited love? Did the Dark Presence twist her feelings for Tom to corrupt her?
FACT__PAGE_DARK_PLACE_OVERLAP__PAGE_DARK_PLACE_OVERLAP=The page describes the Overlap being related to the Dark Place - where Wake was.
FACT__PAGE_DARK_PRESENCE_CORRUPTION__PAGE_DARK_PRESENCE_CORRUPTION=The longer this goes on, the more people will get hurt.
FACT__PAGE_EMMETT__PAGE_EMMETT=The Dark Presence used his phobia, amplified it into hate.
FACT__PAGE_GALE__PAGE_GALE=This man was dying - pneumonia? The Dark Presence used his fear and pain.
FACT__PAGE_HUT_RITUAL_HEART__PAGE_HUT_RITUAL_HEART=Nightingale's heart disappeared from the morgue when he did. How am I going to find it? And who is this "witch"?
FACT__PAGE_HUT_RITUAL_WORD__PAGE_HUT_RITUAL_WORD=Looks like those words tattooed on the heart are a part of the ritual.
FACT__PAGE_MULLIGAN_THORNTON__PAGE_MULLIGAN_THORNTON=Mulligan and Thornton's guilt was a door for the Dark Presence.
FACT__PAGE_NIGHTINGALE__PAGE_NIGHTINGALE=Nightingale hated Wake. Did that Darkness use that hatred?
FACT__PAGE_OVERLAP_MANIFESTING__PAGE_OVERLAP_MANIFESTING=For the Overlap to form, it can't just be an urban legend - it must be supported by an accompanying narrative in the Dark Place.
FACT__PAGE_OVERLAP_SITES__PAGE_OVERLAP_SITES=So Overlaps can only form in specific places.
FACT__PAGE_OVERLAP__PAGE_OVERLAP=Sounds like there is a ritual involving this parade float.
FACT__PAGE_REALITY_AND_DARK_PLACE_2__PAGE_REALITY_AND_DARK_PLACE_2=Sounds like darker, more emotional works are more effective at altering reality.
FACT__PAGE_REALITY_AND_DARK_PLACE__PAGE_REALITY_AND_DARK_PLACE=So it's not just writing. Other art forms work, too.
FACT__PAGE_SONG__PAGE_SONG=I need to play a record to open the Overlap. Another ritual. I should talk to Odin.
FACT__PAGE_WHITE_LIGHT_ZONE__PAGE_WHITE_LIGHT_ZONE=Well-lit areas are safe from the Dark Presence and the Taken.
FACT__PAGE_WLROCK_DS__PAGE_WLROCK_DS=The page was covered in a substance that my flashlight burned away. It mentions a "Witch's Hut."
FACT__PHOTO_CULT__PHOTO_CULT=To stop a cult, we need to understand them. Their ideology, their goal, their members.
FACT__PHOTO_MIND_PLACE__undefined=My mind feels foggy. Why am I in the Mind Place? And why can't I leave? Something is very wrong here...
FACT__PHOTO_RITUAL__PHOTO_RITUAL=I need to protect Tor and Odin while they perform the song. Scratch will likely show up, I should be ready for that, too.
FACT__PHOTO_WAKE_ATTACKED__PHOTO_WAKE_ATTACKED=Scratch tried to take the Clicker. Has Scratch been pretending to be Wake this whole time? Where is the REAL Alan Wake? 
FACT__POKER_TABLE_CULT_TREE__POKER_TABLE_CULT_TREE=This is a lot of equipment just laying around. How long have they been out here?
FACT__POND__POND=Tor disappeared into the pond. It's an Overlap. Need to find a way inside.
FACT__PUUKKO_CW_LOCATION__PUUKKO_CW_LOCATION1=It says the puukko can be found in the gift shop.
FACT__PUUKKO_CW_LOCATION__PUUKKO_CW_LOCATION2=What's a "puukko?" Whatever it is, it's apparently in the gift shop.
FACT__PUUKKO_FLOAT__PUUKKO_FLOAT=A "puukko" is a knife? Haven't heard of that weapon before.
FACT__REMOTE_LOCK_ON_DOOR__REMOTE_LOCK_ON_DOOR=Maybe it's controlled remotely? Need to find the controls.
FACT__RETURN__RETURN=Wake wrote a book in the Dark Place called "Return." Scratch edited it into a horror story. The story's events are slowly coming true.
FACT__RHYME_ENVIRONMENT__RHYME_ENVIRONMENT=According to this, the FBC's goal here is to create some kind of "dimensional opening."
FACT__RITUAL_PREVENTS_TAKEN__RITUAL_PREVENTS_TAKEN=So Nightingale was Taken from the start. The Cult couldn't finish the job because they were interrupted.
FACT__RITUAL_STEPS__RITUAL_STEPS=The steps of the ritual are listed here. Consistent with what we found at Nightingale's murder site.
FACT__ROSE_AWFUL_THING__ROSE_AWFUL_THING=Logan is NOT dead. But what else did the story change about her life? Knowing might help me fight this thing.
FACT__ROSE_CYNTHIA_TOOK_TOR__ROSE_CYNTHIA_TOOK_TOR=Why is Cynthia going to such trouble to get Tor out of the picture?
FACT__ROSE_KEY_SENTENCE__ROSE_KEY_SENTENCE=Rose knows what's going on here. If I tell her that "Wake has returned," maybe she'll think I'm the hero and help me.
FACT__ROSE_KILLING_TAKEN__ROSE_KILLING_TAKEN=She's certainly eccentric, but it doesn't seem like she's part of the Cult.
FACT__ROSE_LUNCH_BOXES__ROSE_LUNCH_BOXES=So it WAS Rose who left the lunch boxes. Guess it's fine that I've been looting them, seeing as I'm the "Hero."
FACT__ROSE_NOTE__ROSE_NOTE=Rose is that waitress from the diner. Is she involved with the Cult?
FACT__ROSE_STASH__FOUND=I found a strange lunchbox. Who left this here? I should keep an eye out for others.
FACT__ROSE_TOR_RESTING__ROSE_TOR_RESTING=Rose isn't being helpful, but they must be around here somewhere.
FACT__SAGA_BELIEVE_IN_YOURSELF__SAGA_BELIEVE_IN_YOURSELF=This place weaponizes your fears. But being afraid won't stop me from trying.
FACT__SAGA_POS_COMPETANT__SAGA_POS_COMPETANT=Casey gave me no end of shit for that speech.
FACT__SAGA_POS_NOT_DELUSIONAL__SAGA_POS_NOT_DELUSIONAL=Did mom know something like this would happen? That I would need to hear these words again some day?
FACT__SAGA_THIS_IS_DARK_PLACE__SAGA_THIS_IS_DARK_PLACE=She's right. Cauldron Lake is the gateway to the Dark Place. I'm IN the Dark Place.
FACT__SAGA__SAGA=YOU FUCKED EVERYTHING UP
FACT__SAME_MOTIVE__SAME_MOTIVE=Their goals were the same. Could mean Scratch and Wake are one and the same. Or just a coincidence.
FACT__SCREWDRIVER__SCREWDRIVER=Worth a try, I guess.
FACT__SHERIFF_ATTACK__SHERIFF_ATTACK=This isn't good. Wake better be alive.
FACT__SMUDGED_TATTOO_SKIN__SMUDGED_TATTOO_SKIN=Is this some kind of tattoo? It's too smudged to read...
FACT__STAFF_BOARD__STAFF_BOARD=No two employees share the same responsibilities.
FACT__STAINED_TABLE__STAINED_TABLE=They really made a mess, here. Caught up in the act, or just sloppy work?
FACT__STRAP_MARKS__STRAP_MARKS=Two of the victims had bruising -  some form of restraint? Strapped or belted down?
FACT__SYMBOLOGY_BRANDING__SYMBOLOGY_BRANDING=Cult imagery is usually subtle - recognizable only by members. Here the use of symbols is enthusiastic, eye catching.
FACT__TABLE_GRAFFITI__TABLE_GRAFFITI=Some kind of signature? Did they intend for this body to be discovered? Or just an idle carving?
FACT__TAKEN_SPEECH__TAKEN_SPEECH=The other Taken were speaking strangely, too. The pages are clearly connected, but how?
FACT__TATTOOED_HEART__TATTOOED_HEART=Did the killers write this on the heart? How? I can't make out what it says.
FACT__THE_MAN_I_DROVE_AWAY__THE_MAN_I_DROVE_AWAY=What "man" did Tor drive away? My father?
FACT__THIRTEEN_YEARS__THIRTEEN_YEARS=Wake was in another world that entire time?
FACT__THORNTON_NIGHTINGALE_ID__THORNTON_NIGHTINGALE_ID=No one's heard from this guy in 13 years. Why surface now? Where's he been?
FACT__THROWN_IN_LAKE__THROWN_IN_LAKE=I remember sinking... but that doesn't explain why I'm in the Mind Place.
FACT__TOR_ANDERSON_POWER__TOR_ANDERSON_POWER=Good. So long as my head is safe from the story, I can focus on fixing this.
FACT__TOR_ANDERSON_POWER__TOR_FREYA_POWERS=They can communicate with me here because they have something similar. Because we're family?
FACT__TOR_BED__TOR_BED=If Tor was brought here to rest, he didn't stay long.
FACT__TOR_CALLED__TOR_CALLED=Tor and Odin are connected to the Cult - and the Clicker. With Wake in FBC custody, this is my best lead. I need to find out what they know.
FACT__TOR_CHOCOLATE_BOX__TOR_CHOCOLATE_BOX=Looks like Tor fell for Cynthia pretty hard.
FACT__TOR_CLICKER_2__TOR_CLICKER_2=Wake wrote the story, so I need him to change the ending. But I can use the Clicker to change something else.
FACT__TOR_CULT_FRIEND__TOR_CULT_FRIEND=Tor and Odin are clearly friendly with the Cult of the Tree. Not conclusively members.
FACT__TOR_DAD__TOR_DAD=Was Tor the reason my father left? It sure sounds like it.
FACT__TOR_FILE_BEHAVIOR__TOR_FILE_BEHAVIOR=Tor's been acting strangely. Violently?
FACT__TOR_FREYA_POWERS__TOR_FREYA_POWERS=Mom called the Mind Place "make-believe." She didn't want me knowing about the Anderson powers.
FACT__TOR_HORROR_STORY__TOR_HORROR_STORY=This would explain why my memories haven't changed like everyone else.
FACT__TOR_MIND_PLACE__TOR_ANDERSON_POWER=What? He makes me sound like some kind of mind reader.
FACT__TOR_NOT_MEMBER__TOR_NOT_MEMBER=Tor and Odin rejected requests to join the Cult of the Tree.
FACT__TOR_THROUGH_CAFETARIA__TOR_THROUGH_CAFETARIA=The door locked behind him. I was so close.
FACT__TOR_WAKES_STORY__TOR_WAKES_STORY=I'll need Wake's cooperation in order to fix this. I can't do it alone.
FACT__TRAILER_PARK_SIGN__TRAILER_PARK_SIGN=The sign says "contact Ilmo Koskela for showings." 
FACT__TRIANGLE_GRAFFITI__TRIANGLE_GRAFFITI=The graffiti is in plain sight. Does it have a deeper significance?
FACT__TRICKSTER__TRICKSTER=It has nice details, but it gives me the creeps.
FACT__TWIGGY_TRIANGLES__TWIGGY_TRIANGLES=What's the purpose? Marking territory?A warning? Feels derivative, like something out of a horror movie.
FACT__UTILITY_BILL__UTILITY_BILL=The bill is in my name, dated February 22, 2018.
FACT__VICTIM_ONE__VICTIM_ONE=The victim was reported missing in 2010. Discovered in 2012, buried in a shallow grave.

FACT__VICTIM_TWO__VICTIM_TWO=Found in Cauldron Lake, 2018. Some organs missing - Predation? State of the body does not match eight years spent in a lake.
FACT__WAKE_ATTACKED__WAKE_ATTACKED=What is their motive? Acting on Scratch's orders?
FACT__WAKE_CAULDRON_LAKE__WAKE_CAULDRON_LAKE=So, what? Cauldron Lake is the gateway to some other world...?
FACT__WAKE_CLICKER_ENDING__WAKE_CLICKER_ENDING=A magic light switch... Where do I even start with that?
FACT__WAKE_CLICKER_WATERY__WAKE_CLICKER_WATERY=I was already looking into the Cult. Two birds, one stone.
FACT__WAKE_CLICKER__WAKE_CLICKER=I've got to get the Clicker into Wake's hands and make him fix this ASAP - but he's still in FBC custody. 
FACT__WAKE_COMMUNICATE__WAKE_COMMUNICATE=I assumed something strange was happening with time, but what if it's simpler than that?
FACT__WAKE_CULT_SCRATCH__WAKE_CULT_SCRATCH=Why work for Scratch? What does the Cult get out of it?
FACT__WAKE_DARK_PLACE__WAKE_DARK_PLACE=So he IS there. Did he ever get out? What the hell is going on here?
FACT__WAKE_EDIT_STORY__WAKE_EDIT_STORY=That only gives us two days to stop this.
FACT__WAKE_FICTION_DARK_PLACE__WAKE_FICTION_DARK_PLACE=So, whatever you write in the Dark Place becomes reality? It can't be that simple.
FACT__WAKE_MANUSCRIPT_PAGE__WAKE_MANUSCRIPT_PAGE=Can't say I understand all this, but if Wake is telling the truth then his magic light switch is the most tangible lead. Let's start there.
FACT__WAKE_PAGES__WAKE_PAGES=I can't exactly fault their logic here.
FACT__WAKE_SCRATCH_DARK_PRESENCE__WAKE_SCRATCH_DARK_PRESENCE=When the Dark Presence looks like Wake, it goes by the name "Scratch." An evil twin is a bit convenient. I'll keep an eye on it.
FACT__WAKE_SCRATCH_PLAN__WAKE_SCRATCH_PLAN=Okay, well I obviously can't let that happen.
FACT__WAKE_STORY_COMING_TRUE__WAKE_STORY_COMING_TRUE=That means the effect isn't immediate. There is still time to fix this.
FACT__WAKE_TRAPPED__WAKE_TRAPPED1=That's probably where Wake is being held. Need to get that door open.
FACT__WAKE_TRAPPED__WAKE_TRAPPED2=Hopefully Wake's safe in there. Need to get that door open.
FACT__WAKE_WAS_SCRATCH__WAKE_WAS_SCRATCH=IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT 
FACT__WAKE_WROTE_PAGES__WAKE_WROTE_PAGES=If Wake is the origin of the pages, then no Cult connection? Unless the Cult is working with Scratch...?
FACT__WALL_SAFE__WALL_SAFE=Don't think a screwdriver will work on this one...
FACT__WATERY_TEST_SITE__WATERY_TEST_SITE=The locations are Ranger Cabin, Trailer Park, Lighthouse, Downtown, Coffee World, and Watery Woods.
FACT__WAY_FORWARD_BLOCKED__WAY_FORWARD_BLOCKED=A dead end. Literally. 
FACT__WA_01__COMPLETED=The rhyme was about a deer being eaten by wolves.
FACT__WA_01__FOUND=The note inside talks about dead Taken, lunchboxes, knitting... interesting.
FACT__WA_01__WA_01_A=There was the page of a story inside, but... this is definitely not like the other pages I've been finding. Fanfiction?
FACT__WA_01__WA_01_B=More fanfiction. With zombies. And mycology. Not going to lie, I'd read more of these.
FACT__WA_02__COMPLETED=This rhyme was about a moose, evading hunters.
FACT__WA_02__FOUND=There was a crossbow inside. Better in my hands than theirs.
FACT__WA_02__WA_02_A=The note inside  mentions the "story." Is this person aware of the horror story, too?

FACT__WA_03__WA_03_A=Fanfiction...? Do I even want to know?

FACT__WA_04__COMPLETED=A rhyme about a deer and a moose lured by some kind of devil.
FACT__WA_04__FOUND=The note inside offers incentives for "getting the Anderson brothers onboard."
FACT__WA_04__WA_04_A=The note inside  mentions the "story." Is this person aware of the horror story, too?
FACT__WA_04__WA_04_B=Another mention of the "story." Whoever this is, they seem aware of Wake's horror story...
FACT__WA_05__COMPLETED=A rhyme about a fisherman who lost their catch to a hungry bear.
FACT__WA_05__FOUND=The stash was barely concealed at all, just sitting on the pier.
FACT__WA_05__WA_05=There were some positive affirmations inside. Cute.
FACT__WA_06__COMPLETED=A rhyme about a woman who fell in love with a bear. Things probably didn't go the way she hoped...
FACT__WA_06__FOUND=The note inside references a Cult operation. "Bigger is Better?" What are they planning...?
FACT__WA_06__WA_06_A=More fanfiction. And boy, what a cliff-hanger.
FACT__WA_06__WA_06_B=There was the page of a story inside, but... this is definitely not like the other pages I've been finding. Fanfiction?

FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART1_01_TEXT=At the talk show I had thought I was home in New York. But none of it had felt right. I was trapped in the Dark Place. A nightmare beyond our world.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART1_02_TEXT=The Writer’s Room was my safe haven. My writing affected what was outside. I was trying to write a story to escape this place. The story was called “Initiation”. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART1_03_TEXT=With the story I wrote, I projected myself out to look for a way to escape. I had tried many times. Failed. This place made me forget
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART1_04_TEXT=Everything Door had said had felt true. Was that part of my writing, or coming from somewhere else?
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART2_01_TEXT=The Dark Presence was out there, hunting me. When it caught me, it killed me. I’d wake up here. I refused to give up. I’d start again.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART2_02_TEXT=The talk show felt real and not real. Alex Casey was my creation, but now it seemed he had a life of his own. He mentioned a lamp shaped like an angel.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART2_03_TEXT=This time, I was determined to get out of the talk show building alive. To escape. To find a way back home to my wife. Alice.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART3_01_TEXT=The janitor seemed to know me. But he got the name wrong. Had I written him into existence? He said I had left something in the basement. A tool to get out. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART3_02_TEXT=I found the lamp in a showbox in the basement. A tool to push the darkness away. In the light, a new reality emerged, carved out from the dark.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART3_03_TEXT=On the security screens I saw myself in the Writer’s Room, writing. Mad. But it was not what I was writing now. A vision from the past I had forgotten?
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART4_01_TEXT=The Dark Place has taken the shape of New York City. I was from New York. I wrote crime books set there for years. I was affecting my surroundings.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER1_PART4_02_TEXT=A mysterious caller on the payphone. I knew him from somewhere. Couldn’t remember from where. He told me I should go to Caldera Street Station.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER2_PART1_01_TEXT=I had to find my way to the subway station. The lamp would make it emerge. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER2_PART1_02_TEXT=I met Casey. He was in this story. This was his city. He talked about a manuscript. It had to be my writing. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER2_PART1_03_TEXT=Casey was killed by the Dark Presence. I had assumed his role. Every writer is a detective, finding the story. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER2_PART2_01_TEXT=Some of the places felt significant here. Had I written them into being? I’d use them as scenes in my story. The station platform was a threshold to be crossed.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER2_PART2_02_TEXT=I saw a vision. An echo of a forgotten idea about a Casey story. A glimpse into another reality. A plot element for this story, to travel deeper.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER2_PART2_03_TEXT=The Dark Place responded to the darkest story threads. All else faded away. A cruel murder site in the depths. Reaching it, I'd be able to travel further.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER2_PART3_01_TEXT=The narrative I wrote to find my way: Casey looking for a missing FBI Agent. The agent on the trail of a murder cult: The Cult of the Word. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER2_PART3_02_TEXT=A place of power revered by the Torchbearers, a group of mystic outsiders in the tunnels. The cultists killed them to invade their holy place. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER2_PART3_03_TEXT=The cult caught the FBI Agent. Sacrificed him in a murder ritual in the place of power to summon the Dark Presence.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER2_PART3_04_TEXT=I found the murder site. I was close to home. Reaching out from the Dark Place. A vision of Saga Anderson, another FBI Agent. She knows I’m trapped here.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER3_PART1_01_TEXT=Parliament Tower had manifested itself here. My home in New York. Full of trepidation, I went there.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER3_PART1_02_TEXT=I was close to home but in the Dark Place still. Reaching, not quite touching. The apartment a perfect echo of the real thing. I could sense Alice there
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER3_PART1_03_TEXT=She was working on an exhibition titled “The Dark Place”. The name was not a coincidence. She was in trouble. Mired in darkness.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER3_PART1_04_TEXT=There were photos of Scratch. Haunting her. Trying to get to her. He was ahead of me. I had to find a way to get home before he got to Alice.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER4_PART1_01_TEXT=The last draft of “Initiation” had brought me to my Writer’s Room, but not the one where I was writing now. A different reality? A different time?
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER4_PART1_02_TEXT=I had died in the end. Again. The Dark Presence had killed me. But something had changed now. My memories of what had happened were not eaten away.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER4_PART1_03_TEXT=There’d been another manuscript there. The title page read “Return”. Had I written it? But then forgotten about it? It felt important. It was important.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER4_PART2_01_TEXT=I would write a new draft of “Initiation”. I knew more now. I would use what I remembered. I had to find my way back to Parliament Tower. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER4_PART2_02_TEXT=I had to find another murder site. A place so dark it remained fixed in this shifting darkness. I would find inspiration and I would write myself there.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER4_PART2_03_TEXT=I had to find a way to get ahead of the Dark Presence. Get ahead of Scratch. I knew how this worked now. I was in control now.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER4_PART3_01_TEXT=I had fooled myself into thinking I could control the story. I had not planned this to be a part of “Initiation”. Who did? Door? Old Gods of Asgard?
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER4_PART3_02_TEXT=Was someone trying to confuse me? Or help me? Remind me of who I was and where I came from? Because I kept forgetting?
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER4_PART3_03_TEXT=My life's story as a song. As a child, I saw nightmares of dark shadows. Was that because I was trapped in the Dark Place now? Dreams as visions through time.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER5_PART1_01_TEXT=The mystery caller was back. He knew things. Wanted to meet me. The Oceanview Hotel. I would find a way there.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER5_PART1_02_TEXT=Thomas Zane. Not a poet or a diver. Or so he claimed now. A film maker. He said we’d been trying to escape together. My manuscript “Return” was the key.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER5_PART1_03_TEXT=If Scratch got his hands on “Return”, he’d be the one to get out. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER5_PART2_01_TEXT=Zane said there was another murder site hidden in the hotel. I would write my way there. A new Casey story. A sequel to the previous one. The return of the murder cult.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER5_PART2_02_TEXT=I had to keep it interesting. Find a twist. A meta layer. A theater play about the cult. A play with a supernatural reputation. The play infiltrated by the real cult.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER5_PART2_03_TEXT=The devil was summoned. The murderer. Scratch lurking behind the cult. An echo of what I was going through. To make my narrative ring true.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER5_PART2_04_TEXT=The murder site in the hotel. I felt closer to home. Saga Anderson had helped me. From the other side. She needed the Clicker. She wanted me to write more.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER6_PART1_01_TEXT=Things were getting worse at home. Alice’s art project had consumed the apartment. She was obsessed with darkness, with finding the truth.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER6_PART1_02_TEXT=All she would find was Scratch. I had to get to the Writer’s Room behind my study door. I needed the truth too. I needed “Return”.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER7_PART1_01_TEXT=Scratch wrote “Return”. He stopped me before I could reach the end with my edits. He had it now. The horror story would still come true.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER7_PART1_02_TEXT=I had to stop Scratch before he escaped. One last chance. One last draft of “Initiation” to get me there.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER7_PART2_01_TEXT=I did not know who or what Door was. Not a talk show host. But I did not create him. An entity affecting the story from outside. Affecting me. Not the only one.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER7_PART2_02_TEXT=My stories had not created anyone. The power of the Dark Place changed lives, messed up lives. Real lives. But I could not stop now. Or else darkness would win.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER7_PART2_03_TEXT=I found Alice’s photos in the basement. A caustic effect on a hand, a spark of light shaped like a bullet. And the Clicker. The pictures had power, like words had power.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER8_PART1_01_TEXT=Zane had lied to me. Scratch wrote “Return”. Zane was a liar. He had secrets. He knew where the murder sites were. I’d make him tell the truth. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER8_PART1_02_TEXT=Zane had worked with Scratch. But Scratch had left him behind. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER8_PART1_03_TEXT=There is a murder site at the cinema. Where Zane’s film was playing. “Nightless Night”, the companion piece to “Return”. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER8_PART2_01_TEXT=Casey would lead me to the murder site. I found more visions of inspiration to write a new Casey story. It needed to be darker to get me there. 
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER8_PART2_02_TEXT=The cult, Zane’s film, Zane himself, Scratch, and Casey were all connected. Pulled by dark gravity. All this madness. Part of the same horror story.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER8_PART2_03_TEXT=Saga Anderson was helping me. I still had a chance to catch Scratch. I had to.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER9_PART1_01_TEXT=My statue in the plaza had changed to Alice’s. Parliament Tower was condemned.
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER9_PART1_02_TEXT=The apartment was empty. No one lived there anymore. Was I too late?
FRAGMENT_CHAPTER9_PART1_03_TEXT=I could hear someone inside my study. The sound of typing. Scratch was there, undoing my edits to “Return”. I would stop him. Even if it was the last thing I’d do.
FRAGMENT_MUSICAL_PART_1_TEXT=I was trapped in an Old Gods of Asgard musical, reliving the trauma of my nightmare-filled childhood.
FRAGMENT_MUSICAL_PART_2_TEXT=I was trapped in the musical, forced to face my issues and failings, unable to cope with my seemingly perfect success story.
FRAGMENT_MUSICAL_PART_3_TEXT=Trapped in the musical, I returned to the events that had led me here, facing the Dark Presence in Bright Falls in 2010 with Alice.
FRAGMENT_MUSICAL_PART_4_TEXT=I struggled to find a way out of the musical, to continue my journey through the Dark Place.
FRAGMENT_RETURN_PART1_01_TEXT=The novel, "Return", come true. My final, divine work of art.
FRAGMENT_RETURN_PART1_02_TEXT=First granted to the people of Bright Falls. And over time, it would spread, this celebration reaching everyone.

GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_MULLIGAN_4350=[0.05-3.51]But don’t worry, Sheriff Breaker took them back to town awhile ago.
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_MULLIGAN_4352=[0.03-2.01]Oh, sure, that's real simple.[2.45-7.28]Just through the hole in the fence, down the hill, towards the lake, around the old convenience store.[7.60-8.45]You can’t miss it.

GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_MULLIGAN_4357=[0.00-4.14]Okay, but we don’t have a coroner in town until after Deerfest.[4.51-5.56]That’s a week away.
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_MULLIGAN_4359=[0.00-2.63]And here’s a key for the gate.[3.05-5.00]It’s a shortcut down the hill.[5.59-7.35]You know, just in case.
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_MULLIGAN_7032=[0.54-3.39]Everything’s been closed since the area was fenced off.[3.96-6.34]The store, the campground, all of it.
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_MULLIGAN_7034=[0.24-6.55]Oh, Sheriff Breaker called and told me to tell you he's got the Bookers over at the Oh Deer Diner in town.
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_SAGA_4332=[0.30-1.34]Saga Anderson.[1.39-2.57]I’ll be leading this case.[2.89-5.32]It seems you already know my partner, Alex Casey.
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_SAGA_4339=[0.00-1.91]What can you tell us about the crime scene?
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_SAGA_4345=[0.51-1.81]Were there any witnesses?
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_SAGA_4351=[0.31-1.22]I want to see the body.[1.93-2.68]How do we get there?
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_SAGA_4356=[0.51-5.11]Deputy, I want the body taken back to town for a proper examination, ASAP.
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_SAGA_7033=[0.00-0.65]Not a problem.[1.16-2.05]I’ll do it myself.
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_THORNTON_4334=[0.05-3.02]When are those damn feds gonna show up, Mulligan?
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_THORNTON_4336=[0.06-0.89]Right here?[1.30-2.28]What do you mean?[2.87-3.66]Are they with you?[3.69-6.29]Ah shit, they didn’t hear me, did they?
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_THORNTON_4342=[0.14-1.28]Tell ‘em about the heart!
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_THORNTON_4347=[0.63-1.70]Mention the city folk![2.07-3.13]Pretty suspicious!
GC_RE01_MULLIGAN_01_THORNTON_4353=[0.14-2.38]Mulligan, tell them I’m here waiting![2.75-3.71]I’ll show them around!
GC_RE01_ROSE_01_ROSE_12961=[0.04-1.90]We all know each other around here![2.66-5.30]It’s been awhile, but I never forget a face.[5.89-6.84]Or a coffee order!
GC_RE01_ROSE_01_ROSE_12964=[0.00-6.72]No one suspicious, but soon enough there’ll be lots of happy people wearing deer masks for Deerfest.[7.49-9.29]Practically everyone will be wearing one!
GC_RE01_ROSE_01_SAGA_12960=[0.05-4.22]So, Rose, help me out, how do you think we know each other?
GC_RE01_ROSE_01_SAGA_12962=[0.00-1.59]Guess I just have one of those faces.
GC_RE01_ROSE_01_SAGA_12963=[0.04-2.31]Seen anything out of the ordinary in town lately?[2.89-4.68]Suspicious people in deer masks?
GC_RE01_ROSE_01_SAGA_12965=[0.13-0.81]Good to know.
GC_RE01_THORNTON_01_CASEY_4362=[0.00-0.91]Nightingale?[1.47-2.80]Robert Nightingale?
GC_RE01_THORNTON_01_SAGA_4360=[0.17-1.55]Any idea who the victim is?
GC_RE01_THORNTON_01_SAGA_4382=[0.51-5.11]Deputy, I want the body taken back to town for a proper examination, ASAP.
GC_RE01_THORNTON_01_SAGA_4384=[0.00-0.65]Not a problem.[1.16-2.05]I’ll do it myself.
GC_RE01_THORNTON_01_SAGA_4387=[0.16-0.65]Thanks.
GC_RE01_THORNTON_01_THORNTON_4361=[0.13-1.12]I sure do![1.68-2.93]His name is Nightingale.[3.12-7.32]He was FBI, came to town about 13 years ago.[7.79-9.78]Haven’t heard a word about him since.[10.07-11.80]Well, until now.
GC_RE01_THORNTON_01_THORNTON_4363=[0.09-2.81]Oh yeah, you probably knew him.[2.81-4.31]Brothers in arms.[5.10-6.42]Oh, and sisters.
GC_RE01_THORNTON_01_THORNTON_4383=[0.47-4.94]Sure, but the coroner won’t be in town for another week, after Deerfest.
GC_RE01_THORNTON_01_THORNTON_4386=[0.03-0.48]Oh, yeah.[0.53-1.70]Sheriff Breaker called.[2.07-5.04]He's got the Bookers over at the Oh Deer Diner in town.
GC_RE01_THORNTON_01_THORNTON_4388=[0.09-3.40]Oh, and I've got a key to the gate.[3.40-6.49]It’s a shortcut back to the parking lot, just up the hill.
GC_RE02_CASEY_01_CASEY_12972=[0.03-3.09]I’ve watched you arrest plenty of monsters, Anderson.
GC_RE02_CASEY_01_CASEY_12975=[0.00-4.56]The killers are usually the ones performing the ritual, not the detective.[5.40-7.49]Acting out their sick fantasy.[8.42-10.19]They may be trying to get you involved.[10.79-13.35]Forcing you into their twisted world.
GC_RE02_CASEY_01_SAGA_12971=[0.04-1.36]After we find Nightingale...[1.97-2.65]what then?[4.26-5.79]I’ve never arrested a monster.
GC_RE02_CASEY_01_SAGA_12973=[0.00-1.10]You know what I mean.[2.06-3.24]Monster monsters.[4.97-6.81]Light worked against him at the morgue.[7.75-10.31]That might be the only way to stop him from hurting anyone else.
GC_RE02_CASEY_01_SAGA_12974=[0.03-3.76]Monsters, Overlaps, rituals.[5.68-7.12]What do you make of all of this?
GC_RE02_CASEY_01_SAGA_12976=[0.05-4.96]But with dead men coming alive, the word “ritual” starts to have more weight behind it.[6.27-9.40]We need to look around, learn what this ritual is.
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_ILMO_7154=[0.28-3.83]I’m Ilmo Koskela, fantastic to meet you.[4.64-7.70]And yes, Steven here hired me to show him through the woods.[8.06-10.42]He’s in town on important government business.[11.02-13.04]Fixing this impressive piece of hardware.
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_ILMO_7156=[0.03-1.93]And I bet you two are here about that murder.[2.67-3.47]Nasty stuff.[4.96-5.52]How’s that going?
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_ILMO_7159=[0.00-2.64]That is one gorgeous sweater, Saga.[4.01-5.05]Looks Nordic.[5.08-6.73]I bet a family member made it?
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_ILMO_7161=[0.03-0.77]I knew it![1.47-4.39]My mom used to knit those sweaters for me and my brother.[6.13-10.14]Watery, my hometown, was founded by Finnish immigrants.[11.38-15.45]Between your name and the sweater, I figured your family might be from Finland too.[15.83-16.94]Suomi Finland![17.19-18.54](Pulla)![18.69-19.24](Karjalanpiirakka)!
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_ILMO_7165=[0.03-1.90]That’s the raccoons.[2.44-5.74]They grow real big here, with teeth like you wouldn’t believe.[6.52-8.17]Can gnaw right through a garbage can.
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_ILMO_7167=[0.00-1.43]People tend to tell me things.[2.04-4.74]The Koskela brothers are kind of a household name around here.[4.96-11.32]Speaking of, if you’re looking for some fun then stop by Watery, just down the road from Bright Falls.[11.49-14.03]There’s our Coffee World amusement park.[14.15-15.59]There is sauna.[15.79-17.83](Sauna ja vihta)![18.06-20.36]And we offer a variety of guided tours.[20.36-23.73]Hunting, fishing, hiking, whatever strikes your fancy.[23.91-25.81]You name it, we probably got it!
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_SAGA_7153=[0.00-0.52]Hello.[1.16-2.20]Saga Anderson.[3.46-5.04]Are you two supposed to be here?
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_SAGA_7157=[0.00-1.06]What is this thing?
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_SAGA_7160=[0.03-1.56]My mother made this sweater for me.[2.21-2.95]How’d you know?
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_SAGA_7162=[0.00-0.71]Close.[1.15-3.31]My mom’s family was from Sweden originally.[4.39-6.29]I don’t know much about them beyond that.[7.19-9.13]The sweater’s just something to remember her by.
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_SAGA_7163=[0.03-2.79]Steven, we’re investigating a murder that occurred nearby.[3.75-5.37]What can you tell me about your bureau?
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_SAGA_7166=[0.00-1.63]How’d you hear about the murder, Ilmo?[2.62-4.07]Do you know anything that could help us?
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_STEVEN_7155=[0.03-1.80]I work for the FBC, ma’am.[1.80-2.90]I’m authorized to be here.
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_STEVEN_7158=[0.15-1.57]Just a monitoring station, ma’am.[2.09-6.04]The Federal Bureau of Control checks volcanic activity and air toxicity levels.[6.33-7.36]No need to worry though.[7.79-9.41]It’s mostly for research purposes.
GC_RE02_ILMO_01_STEVEN_7164=[0.00-1.92]Nothing that isn’t classified, I’m afraid.[2.51-5.11]But I don’t know anything about a murder.[5.94-8.25]Operations here are run by a different department.[8.30-9.75]I’m just here to make some repairs.[10.29-12.77]The wiring on this thing frays every couple months.
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_ODIN_11995=[0.12-1.75]Same as you, kiddo![2.30-3.64]Tor Anderson![4.14-5.70]Odin Anderson![6.10-8.88]The Old Gods of Asgard![9.28-11.03]That’s our band!
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_ODIN_12000=[0.09-1.49]Right behind us![1.87-4.63]We’ve been looking after it since you left.
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_ODIN_12005=[0.14-4.96]Our little Saga, all grown up and finally home.[5.50-7.57]Sure, we’ve had a few sips.[7.94-9.39]Just a taste.[9.81-12.44]The famous Anderson moonshine![13.03-16.00]Nectar of the gods![16.72-17.74]You want some?
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_ODIN_12009=[0.00-6.72]You can see all sorts of wonderful things when you make your way down the bottle![6.72-9.03]Even more so with just one eye.
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_11994=[0.00-1.26]Your name is Anderson?
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_11997=[0.36-1.86]I like the sound of that.
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_11998=[0.00-3.37]Tor, Odin, Saga.[5.07-6.32]All Norse-inspired.[7.28-8.46]Plus the same last name.[9.82-10.78]A coincidence?[12.81-15.39]Did the horror story change their names to match mine?
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_11999=[0.04-2.53]So do you know where the Anderson trailer is?
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_12001=[0.10-0.68]Uh-huh.[1.84-2.89]Thanks for the help.
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_12003=[0.03-2.78]Looks like you two have had a bit too much fun.
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_12006=[0.00-0.75]No, thanks.
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_12007=[0.00-2.39]Have you seen any strange people in deer masks?
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_12010=[0.00-0.75]Okay.[1.26-2.05]Never mind.
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_TOR_11996=[0.12-0.92]Your...[2.24-5.39]You are Saga Anderson, god damn it![6.25-8.02]A Viking goddess!
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_TOR_12002=[0.11-1.81]Any time, kiddo.
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_TOR_12004=[0.17-2.90]She sees right through us, bro.[3.95-5.22]She has the power![6.08-8.90]This calls for a fucking celebration!
GC_RE03_ANDERSONS_01_TOR_12008=[0.20-2.14]I haven’t drunk enough for that yet!
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_BLUM_11940=[0.65-1.38]Ah![1.41-4.46]Long time and no see, Miss Anderson.[5.56-7.70]Tor and Odin are not here.[7.92-11.57]They are old tricksters, always sneaking off.
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_BLUM_11943=[0.78-2.02]Sure![2.02-4.65]Watery Lighthouse Trailer Park.[5.55-7.28]Ilmo Koskela owns it.[7.91-9.67]Owns many things in town.
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_BLUM_11945=[0.81-3.86]I saw Ilmo and his brother at the bridge.[4.06-6.45]Well, what used to be the bridge.
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_BLUM_11947=[0.77-2.71]Everybody knows Ilmo![3.47-6.01]He is with his brother, waiting at the bridge.[6.18-8.21]Well, what used to be the bridge.
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_BLUM_11949=[0.65-2.79]I live in Bright Falls.[3.40-4.98]You have seen me around.[5.61-6.78]I am Mr. Blum![7.36-8.54]You call me Vladimir!
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_BLUM_11950=[0.47-2.02]I work at the nursing home![2.80-5.34]I take care of your old people.[5.49-6.75]We are on day trip![6.75-7.42]Music, sauna![7.42-8.77]The good times![8.93-10.34]I bring them here in the bus.
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_SAGA_11939=[0.00-0.52]Hello![1.18-2.25]Do you have a second?
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_SAGA_11941=[0.05-3.19]Sorry, no, I wanted to ask about something else.
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_SAGA_11942=[0.00-1.84]Can you point me to any trailers around here?[3.59-4.98]Weird question, I know.
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_SAGA_11944=[0.00-0.87]And where is Ilmo?
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_SAGA_11946=[0.00-1.68]I’m looking for Ilmo Koskela.[2.25-3.61]The manager of trailer park.[4.41-5.03]Do you know him?
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_SAGA_11948=[0.00-0.98]Do you live around here?
GC_RE03_BLUM_01_SAGA_11951=[0.00-1.99]The elderly are very important.[2.79-3.88]And it’s a very nice bus.[4.86-5.29]Thanks.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11960=[0.00-1.82]Another satisfied customer![2.48-5.81]I just hope he remembers to write a good review on the website.[6.58-8.46]Great to see you back in Watery, Saga.[8.90-10.07]Everyone in town missed you.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11965=[0.79-2.20]Then you’re in luck![3.06-7.53]Introducing the brothers who need no introduction, the Koskelas![8.00-14.50]Ilmo, voted businessman of the year by the Bright Falls Herald, and Jaakko, stay-at-home dad!
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11967=[0.44-4.82]Ah, I missed that Anderson sense of humor.[5.22-6.89]It’s great to see you again, Saga.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11971=[0.00-2.80]Yeah, we always thought it was an urban legend.[3.40-5.87]Kids drawing creepy symbols to scare each other.[5.87-9.44]But now it’s gotten pretty damn real, huh?
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11974=[1.40-2.91]We’re all for that.[4.95-6.74]As normal as it ever gets around here.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11977=[0.04-7.45]Uh, yeah, I’m pretty sure the owner of the Watery Lighthouse Trailer Park, me, can help with that.[7.45-9.33]Good to have our funniest resident back.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11979=[1.11-6.34]If this is your way of getting out of any outstanding bills, don’t worry, they’ve been handled.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11984=[0.73-2.09]Yeah, I have a spare set.[2.51-4.20]They’re just over at Coffee World.[4.76-7.75]I’d get them for you, but Jaakko and I have to head to Bright Falls.[8.38-10.19]The spare keys are in the gift shop safe.[10.98-13.63]I’ll call ahead and have someone get them out for you.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11985=[0.29-5.38]The road’s flooded, but if you just follow this trail behind me, it will lead you there.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11987=[1.10-3.62]You mean you haven’t seen our commercial for it?[4.60-8.00]Coffee World is a smooth blend of rides, food, and fun.[8.00-11.45]We even had a real moose, until just recently.[13.05-18.89]Plus, right next to Coffee World is the workshop of our own Kalevala Knights motorcycle club.[19.92-22.40]We’re busy building the floats for Deerfest.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11990=[0.06-2.20]They’re more than “commercials”, Saga.[3.01-8.94]Our goal is to both entertain and educate local viewers about the fine products and services we provide.[9.48-13.51]And Jaakko here really comes alive in front of the camera.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11992=[0.75-4.71]Hey, I’m the writer, producer, co-lead, director...
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_ILMO_11993=[0.12-3.39]Do yourself a favor and check them all out.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_JAAKKO_11961=[0.92-2.76]Super nice to see you again, Saga.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_JAAKKO_11966=[0.31-1.57]I’m proud of that.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_JAAKKO_11968=[1.04-3.01]Yeah, super nice to see you again, Saga.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_JAAKKO_11972=[1.02-2.33]It’s terrible what happened.[2.33-5.23]We’re all in shock.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_JAAKKO_11980=[1.08-3.86]Must be hard coming back to where you and your little girl lived.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_JAAKKO_11983=[0.03-0.66]Good for you.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_JAAKKO_11988=[0.95-2.09]Don’t go peeking though.[4.12-6.73]You know, we’re saving the big reveal for Deerfest.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_JAAKKO_11991=[1.24-2.85]Fuck off.[3.46-5.68]I’m just there for the free beer.[5.71-7.79]Not sure what Ilmo’s excuse is.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11959=[0.03-0.91]Hey, Ilmo.[1.61-3.53]How did your walk in the woods with Steven go?
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11962=[0.06-1.73]They act like they’ve known me for years.[2.66-3.80]This keeps happening.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11963=[0.07-2.89]Hey, I’m looking for Ilmo Koskela.[3.53-4.62]Owner of the trailer park?
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11964=[0.03-1.82]Sorry, I don’t think we’ve met.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11969=[0.06-1.73]They act like they’ve known me for years.[2.66-3.80]This keeps happening.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11970=[0.04-1.85]Are you familiar with the Cult of the Tree?
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11973=[0.16-2.16]Well we’re looking into it.[2.90-4.95]Hoping to get things back to normal soon.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11975=[0.00-1.27]You own the trailer park, right?[2.51-4.34]Mind if I take a look inside?
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11976=[0.03-2.00]I need to find a specific trailer in town.[2.75-3.77]Can you help me with that?
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11978=[0.49-1.23]Resident?[2.84-4.09]I don’t understand what you mean.
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11981=[0.00-1.96]It’s like they remember a different reality.[3.35-5.53]Is the horror story messing with their memories?
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11982=[0.07-4.88]All joking aside, yes, I would like to see my trailer.[5.89-7.13]Do you have a spare set of keys?
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11986=[0.05-1.33]So what is Coffee World?
GC_RE03_KOSKELAS_01_SAGA_11989=[0.10-1.19]So...[2.07-3.06]your commercials.

GC_RE03_NORMAN_01_SAGA_11952=[0.03-0.93]Enjoying the sauna?

GC_RE03_WAKE_01_SAGA_11930=[0.09-3.87]Alan, if I’m gonna act on this information, you need to be honest with me.
GC_RE03_WAKE_01_SAGA_11932=[0.03-3.71]Is he confused or is he hiding something?

GC_RE03_WAKE_01_SAGA_11935=[0.00-2.23]You’re not the only one trying to solve this.[3.16-4.39]This is our job.
GC_RE03_WAKE_01_SAGA_11937=[0.00-4.26]You wrote these pages in the Dark Place, so why are we finding them here?
GC_RE03_WAKE_01_SAGA_16175=[0.00-1.22]That’s all for now, Mr. Wake.[2.08-3.74]Thank you for your cooperation.
GC_RE03_WAKE_01_WAKE_11927=[0.00-0.75]The cult...[2.15-4.53]Yes, yes.[5.09-6.11]They have the Clicker.

GC_RE03_WAKE_01_WAKE_11938=[0.00-1.32]I think I wrote them.[3.09-5.80]I remember writing an endless amount of pages.[7.43-11.21]When this happened before, the pages were being sent from the Dark Place to help me.[13.26-14.85]Maybe the same thing is happening here.

GC_RE05_RESIDENTS_01_NORMAN_3691=[0.00-2.16]I’m happy to get out of that house![2.50-8.67]Isn’t it strange that I’ve lived in Bright Falls my whole life and I can’t remember this building?

GC_RE05_RESIDENTS_01_NORMAN_3697=[0.00-2.60]“Take a swim in the pond, Norman".[2.78-5.16]"Drink some water, Norman".[5.64-8.31]No one tells Norman MacDonald what to do!

GC_RE05_RESIDENTS_01_SAGA_3694=[0.05-3.94]Have any of you noticed anything odd about Ms. Weaver?
GC_RE05_RESIDENTS_01_SAGA_3699=[0.03-2.25]Is there anyone who didn’t show up?
GC_RE05_RESIDENTS_01_SAGA_3703=[0.00-2.28]Mandy-May, are you all right?[2.94-3.59]You’re bleeding.

GC_RE05_ROSE_01_ROSE_3601=[0.38-6.18]Oh, no, I was just, you know, tidying the, uh, the um -
GC_RE05_ROSE_01_ROSE_3602=[0.40-5.46]I’m so glad you’re visiting again, Saga, but Odin and Tor can’t see anyone today.
GC_RE05_ROSE_01_ROSE_3604=[0.44-1.30]Sorry.[1.47-5.70]They had a little too much fun on our trip to Watery and need to rest.
GC_RE05_ROSE_01_ROSE_3607=[0.56-1.45]Um...[2.84-3.16]sure.[3.80-5.09]They always love visitors.
GC_RE05_ROSE_01_ROSE_3608=[0.09-0.80]Come on in.[1.16-3.26]Not smart to be outside when the sun goes down.
GC_RE05_ROSE_01_SAGA_3599=[0.00-0.66]Hello, Rose.
GC_RE05_ROSE_01_SAGA_3600=[0.00-1.68]I thought I’d swing by, see the family.[2.76-4.06]Not a bad time, is it?
GC_RE05_ROSE_01_SAGA_3603=[0.03-1.35]I was just on the phone with Tor.[2.09-3.26]He invited me over.
GC_RE05_ROSE_01_SAGA_3605=[0.03-2.02]I need an excuse to get in and talk to them.
GC_RE05_ROSE_01_SAGA_3606=[0.00-0.85]That’s too bad.[1.65-4.05]Okay if I say hi to the other residents before I go?
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_ROSE_3610=[1.19-2.74]Oh, it’s been years.[3.16-5.55]We were all so sad when you left...
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_ROSE_3611=[0.29-1.87]after the accident.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_ROSE_3613=[0.28-0.64]Mmhm.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_ROSE_3615=[0.90-3.50]Oh, you mean the little bump on his noggin?[5.13-5.75]It’s nothing.[6.22-8.05]The residents like to exaggerate.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_ROSE_3618=[0.32-3.65]Oh, that’s where we provide our health services for the residents.[3.89-9.23]We have a rehab facility, dining area, and beds for special round-the-clock care.[9.72-11.48]To stay young, stay limber!
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_ROSE_3620=[0.84-6.80]No, he’s- well, yes, but you really shouldn’t go in there right now.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_ROSE_3623=[0.08-6.07]But, it’s just, there’s some, uh, things that...
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_ROSE_3624=[1.62-2.73]Yes, okay.[3.04-3.92]I’ll let you in.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_12582=[0.03-2.24]Let’s see exactly what she thinks she remembers.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_12583=[0.03-1.14]Oh, fuck this.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_12584=[0.00-0.84]It’s useless.[1.48-2.85]I need to stop the story.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_12585=[0.03-1.33]I need to check Tor’s room.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_3609=[0.00-1.12]You said I’ve been here before.[1.12-4.44]When was the last time I visited?
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_3612=[0.03-1.00]My daughter didn’t drown.[2.07-3.20]You’re remembering wrong.[4.51-6.89]She's at home, watching Night Springs with her father.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_3614=[0.00-2.53]Mandy-May and Norman said Tor is hurt.[3.46-4.77]Why didn’t you mention that earlier?
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_3616=[0.01-0.72]Uh-huh.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_3617=[0.00-1.36]What’s in the Wellness Center?
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_3619=[0.00-1.63]Tor’s in the Wellness Center, isn’t he.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_3621=[0.07-1.40]I’m gonna need you to unlock the door.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_3622=[0.00-1.45]This is FBI business.
GC_RE05_ROSE_02_SAGA_3625=[0.00-0.71]Thank you, Rose.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_12074=[0.28-1.19]Oh, sure.[2.18-4.39]You’re the hero so you must know all about it.[5.04-9.40]All you need is a strong light, and then your conventional methods of extreme violence.[9.89-10.59]Simple stuff.[11.45-13.46]The tough part is hiding the bodies!
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_12076=[0.33-1.85]Just doing my part, sister!
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_12110=[0.16-3.58]Oh, this kind of stuff rolls right off their backs.[4.49-6.35]They’ve lived very rich lives.[7.05-8.43]Very resilient.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_12112=[0.30-4.82]But I already told everyone to wait at the designated muster point on the front porch.[5.87-7.34]We run drills every few months.[7.91-8.90]I’m so proud of them.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_12113=[0.20-1.58]We’re pretty used to this kind of thing.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_12115=[1.10-1.59]Guilty![2.03-5.19]They were the only Alan-related containers I could find online.[5.73-10.34]He told me to destroy the Taken around town and I needed some way to stash my gear.[11.22-15.51]I even recruited Mandy-May to make knit-work decorations to mark the sites.[16.24-19.57]The stashes are for you too, you being the hero and all.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_3673=[0.70-2.80]What on earth do you mean, Saga?[3.53-7.55]Tor is resting, in the Wellness Center, remember?
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_3675=[0.13-2.02]Haha, okay!
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_3678=[0.12-1.59]Now, now.[2.34-4.22]Let’s cool it with the language.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_3680=[1.79-4.54]Oh my god.[5.53-7.81]You’re the hero![7.81-10.80]You’re here to save Alan![11.00-13.88]Now I feel so silly for trying to keep you out of the Wellness Center.[14.46-19.92]I locked Tor and Gail in there after they lost it and I didn’t want you getting hurt.[19.92-23.40]Before I forget, here’s the page Wake told me to give you.[24.27-26.61]Oh, and you’ll need my keys to get around.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_3683=[0.34-1.34]Cynthia took him.[2.41-4.56]I knew someone was messing with Tor’s head.[5.48-7.25]There’s something wrong with the water here.[7.74-10.22]Pipes acting up, black stuff coming out.[11.49-13.64]Cynthia’s probably behind that too.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_3685=[0.18-3.60]Oh no, she’s way too frail for that.[4.30-8.27]But she used to be this town’s best defense against the forces of darkness.[9.04-10.78]Well, after Alan.[12.58-13.88]But I guess it finally got her.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_3687=[0.26-5.89]He leaves me messages in funny places like the newspaper, books...[6.04-8.37]once he even wrote to me with a cloud.[8.71-12.04]If it’s something really important, he tells me in a dream.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_ROSE_3689=[0.15-7.74]Ways I can help him, how I can stay safe, good dinner recipes, ways to kill Taken, lots of stuff.[8.30-13.63]I’ve been finding some pages of writing lately too, so he must be working on a new book.[14.52-15.04]Exciting!
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_12073=[0.20-2.14]Wake tells you how to kill Taken?
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_12075=[0.07-2.32]I honestly don’t know how to react to this.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_12109=[0.13-1.75]You need to get the residents out of here.[2.44-3.31]It’s not safe.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_12111=[0.06-2.00]I’m impressed with how prepared you are.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_12114=[0.00-3.16]You’re the one leaving those Alex Casey lunchboxes around, aren’t you?
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_12116=[0.00-0.59]Thanks.[0.93-1.82]I already have been.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_3672=[0.00-0.90]What was that?[2.04-3.08]Where did Tor go?
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_3674=[0.43-0.90]What?[1.49-3.59]We both just saw him go in the pond.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_3677=[0.12-3.49]Are you fucking with me or is this the story again?
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_3679=[0.09-5.63]Rose, uh, Wake has returned.
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_3682=[0.07-1.36]What happened to Tor just now?
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_3684=[0.03-2.56]Does Cynthia have any connection to the Cult of the Tree?
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_3686=[0.15-1.43]Wake is in custody.[2.15-3.58]How have you been in contact with him?
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_3688=[0.38-0.87]Okay.[1.88-3.81]And what does he say to you with these clouds?
GC_RE05_ROSE_03_SAGA_4130=[0.07-0.94]I need to get to work.
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_CASEY_12430=[0.00-2.76]Don’t give me that worried look, Anderson.[3.33-5.53]It’s just a flesh wound.[6.41-14.51]Gave me a chance to have a nice chat about ex-wives with Kiran.[14.51-16.91]Agent Estevez, I mean.
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_CASEY_12432=[0.00-0.96]I’m fine.[1.79-4.12]What’s the situation on your end?
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_CASEY_12435=[0.00-0.94]Wait, Saga.[1.87-2.81]What do you...?[4.56-6.20]Logan is gone.[7.11-10.31]She has been for a long time.
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_CASEY_12438=[0.00-1.61]Give ‘em hell, Anderson.[2.85-7.62]Just remember, some things in life can’t be fixed with a light switch.
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_CASEY_12439=[0.03-4.98]As for the power problem, here, I found a fuse on those poor bastards there.
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_CASEY_12442=[0.03-3.70]Wake was telling the truth about the Cult being after him.[4.33-8.79]That thing, the Dark Presence, it’s real too.[9.54-10.43]I saw it.[11.07-13.33]A fucked up monster cloud.[13.74-15.27]Wake tried to warn me.[15.89-17.18]It knocked me out.[17.73-20.05]FBC found me in the woods later.
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_SAGA_12429=[0.00-0.98]How are you holding up?
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_SAGA_12431=[0.00-1.23]Making new friends, huh?[1.92-2.59]I’m jealous.[5.02-6.35]Are you sure you’re okay?
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_SAGA_12433=[0.00-1.99]Watery turned out to be a good lead.[2.78-4.59]Found the Clicker, and the Cult.[6.27-10.34]But the horror story is changing reality, like Wake said it would.
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_SAGA_12434=[0.00-0.49]Logan.[0.49-0.90]She’s...[3.73-5.49]The story claims she died here.[8.17-9.30]But we can stop it.
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_SAGA_12436=[0.00-1.98]Casey’s affected by the horror story too.[3.63-5.12]I’m fighting for them all now.
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_SAGA_12437=[0.00-1.19]I’m gonna fix this, Casey.[2.42-5.49]You, Logan, all of it.[7.51-9.38]I just need to get the power back on first.
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_SAGA_12440=[0.00-0.86]I’ll take care of it.
GC_RE06_CASEY_01_SAGA_12441=[0.00-1.33]What happened at the hotel?
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_CASEY_12481=[0.00-1.72]He almost won me over.[2.35-4.10]I should have trusted my gut.[4.91-7.59]Had a bad feeling about him when we found him at the lake.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_CASEY_12482=[0.00-6.43]When that insane monster cloud came at me in the woods, I saw a face inside it.[6.87-7.93]Wake’s.[8.61-11.14]I think he was always a monster.[11.20-12.65]Always Scratch.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_CASEY_12484=[0.00-4.08]I remember you and David were having problems.[4.83-6.31]You needed a break.[6.66-8.78]You and Logan moved to Watery.[9.85-14.42]And then Logan...[15.87-18.06]That awful thing happened.[19.20-23.92]After you came back to work, I thought you’d be the perfect partner for this case,[24.13-26.93]if you were willing to return to the area.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_CASEY_12487=[0.00-6.30]Wake, Scratch, whoever that was, said the story could be used to attack us.[6.94-9.78]We all need to question what’s real.[10.61-17.05]With that said, how do we know the story isn’t giving you false hope?
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_CASEY_12490=[0.00-2.29]It looked right from where we were standing.[2.84-4.88]Nothing’s what it seems in this case.[5.41-9.06]Too many stories contradicting each other.[10.46-13.61]Too many versions of the truth.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_CASEY_12492=[0.05-1.72]I’ll buy the coffee, Anderson.[2.40-3.59]Partners to the end.[4.90-7.52]This case is one for the books.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_SAGA_12480=[0.03-2.44]Scratch pretended to be Wake to trick us.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_SAGA_12483=[0.00-3.29]You really don’t remember Logan living in Virginia with me and David?
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_SAGA_12485=[0.00-0.60]Okay.[1.65-2.25]That’s enough.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_SAGA_12486=[0.00-1.75]The story is changing your memories.[2.72-4.16]What you’re remembering is fiction.[5.59-6.68]Logan is alive.[7.95-10.02]I’m not divorced.[10.88-12.13]We never moved here.[13.77-14.91]I remember the truth.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_SAGA_12488=[0.03-1.01]I can’t convince them.[1.57-3.12]I just need to change the story.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_SAGA_12489=[0.03-2.38]So the Cult of the Tree actually kills Taken.[3.27-7.01]They were on our side, even if their methods are misguided and criminal.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_SAGA_12491=[0.00-2.45]We have a lot of catching up to do after this thing is all over.[3.79-5.27]Everything is different now.[6.13-7.08]My family.[7.30-7.79]Me.[8.62-9.95]The whole fucking world.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_SAGA_12493=[0.03-1.12]I see what you did there.
GC_RE06_CASEY_02_SAGA_23374=[0.05-1.06]We got that one wrong.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_12417=[0.26-2.42]Where to fucking start?[3.32-9.86]We came to check out a system alert at Cauldron Lake, but it’s worse than we could handle.[9.96-11.62]A real boondoggle.[12.59-16.25]The police, my own agents, most were invaded before we could even react.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_12419=[0.03-2.46]Alan Wake is a parautilitarian.[3.44-5.18]The word’s a mouthful, so you know it’s serious.[5.92-8.05]We have him locked up in the holding cells, per protocol.[8.05-9.80]He’s connected to the Shadow in some way.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_12421=[0.33-0.64]Okay.[2.66-4.68]Protocols don’t mean that much at this point anyway.[5.54-7.37]Don’t make me regret this, Anderson.[9.08-12.15]Until the power’s back on, the door to the holding cells won’t open.[12.36-14.27]There’s a fusebox downstairs in the basement.[15.12-15.45]Here.[16.84-17.56]You’ll need these keys.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_12424=[0.00-2.85]Bright Falls is the site of a recurring Altered World Event.[3.48-5.33]The Shadow is stronger than we expected.[6.15-12.61]We’re low on resources, problems at HQ, but we do have equipment for dealing with the Shaded threat.[12.61-14.75]We were caught off guard before we could set it up.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_12426=[0.00-1.28]Yeah, we found him.[1.89-2.64]Out in the woods.[2.64-7.13]Had a close encounter with the Shadow and it did something to him.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_12428=[0.00-0.57]He's alive.[1.80-3.86]We took him down to the morgue for an examination.[3.86-5.26]Haven’t heard anything since the attack.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_SAGA_12416=[0.00-0.80]What happened here?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_SAGA_12418=[0.00-0.81]Where is Wake?[1.54-2.52]I know what’s going on here.[3.16-4.22]Wake can fix this.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_SAGA_12420=[0.00-2.91]Estevez, I need to see Wake.[4.33-5.83]How do I get into the cell block?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_SAGA_12422=[0.00-1.08]Back into the morgue, huh?[2.43-3.24]Fantastic.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_SAGA_12423=[0.00-2.07]What did the FBC come here to do?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_SAGA_12425=[0.00-2.32]Have you found my partner, Agent Casey?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_01_SAGA_12427=[0.00-0.73]Is he okay?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_ESTEVEZ_12444=[0.17-3.58]I had a hell of a time avoiding those Taken, ended up back here.[5.39-8.65]Anyway, I wanted to warn you that we have the Koskela brothers in the cells as well.[8.83-10.61]They’re the ringleaders of the Cult of the Tree.[11.05-12.06]Don’t let your guard down.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_ESTEVEZ_12446=[1.00-1.86]We were the help.[2.50-3.77]Well, us and the Lake House.[4.67-7.94]But we still have Bureau gear specifically engineered to fight this threat.[8.24-9.48]It’s stored in the backlot.[9.66-11.68]We were setting it up when the Taken interrupted us.[11.86-14.91]We have light arrays, a containment cell, etcetera.[14.91-16.55]We’re not out of this fight yet.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_ESTEVEZ_13027=[0.34-3.62]It’s a Bureau research facility at Cauldron Lake, studying the affects of this AWE.[3.62-8.11]A different department runs it, and they never tell me what they’re doing in there.[8.14-11.87]I tried to reach them when I got into town, but no response.[12.86-13.60]Not a good sign.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_ESTEVEZ_13029=[0.00-3.79]It’s a Bureau research facility at Cauldron Lake, set up to study the affects of this AWE.[3.79-6.89]When I got into town, I went there for back-up.[7.98-9.28]The whole station is lost.[9.37-10.22]Taken by the Shadow.[11.24-14.95]Lost a lot of agents, barely got out myself.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_ESTEVEZ_13031=[0.00-3.54]It’s a Bureau research facility at Cauldron Lake, set up to study the affects of this AWE.[3.54-8.40]When I got into town, I went there for back-up, but the emergency lockdown has triggered.[9.51-14.35]Either the situation out here caused the lockdown, or something even worse has happened inside.[15.33-16.77]I didn’t have time to figure out a way in.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_ESTEVEZ_13033=[1.01-3.67]That’s bad news, but I suspected as much.[4.69-6.99]They were never willing to share information with my department.[6.99-10.36]Always too eager to mess with things they didn’t fully understand.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_SAGA_12443=[0.00-0.67]What’s going on?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_SAGA_12445=[0.00-1.69]Is the FBC sending any help?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_SAGA_13026=[0.00-1.11]What’s at the Lake House?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_SAGA_13028=[0.00-1.11]What’s at the Lake House?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_SAGA_13030=[0.00-1.11]What’s at the Lake House?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_02_SAGA_13032=[0.03-1.35]I went to the Lake House.[2.32-3.18]It wasn’t pretty.[4.20-6.10]We definitely can’t expect help from them.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_CASEY_12467=[0.00-3.11]Kiran, you’re better off without her.[4.25-5.38]I know I am.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_CASEY_12472=[0.00-2.11]I’m not filling out the paperwork for this one.[2.71-3.91]Wouldn’t know where to start.[4.70-5.70]But I’m sold.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_CASEY_12475=[0.03-2.25]Scratch will try to get you, Anderson.[3.33-4.47]You’ll need back-up.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_CASEY_12478=[0.00-1.86]And this work of art, Anderson?[2.65-3.90]What’s the plan for that?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_12457=[0.04-0.57]Hold up.[1.15-6.60]You brought a paranatural object in here without telling me, and then almost handed it over to a hostile entity.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_12459=[3.14-4.29]You got that right.[5.36-7.69]Let’s start acting like we’re on the same side, yeah?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_12461=[0.03-2.61]Good news, we have Bureau intel on all of this.[2.81-4.75]Bad news, it’s highly-classified.[4.85-8.64]Good news, consider yourself deputized into the Federal Bureau of Control.[8.64-10.70]Here’s a key to the cell where we keep the files.[11.17-12.13]Happy reading.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_12464=[0.58-2.82]AWEs are localized distortions of reality.[2.82-5.39]The area outside town may not be affected.[5.54-7.40]Sometimes they expand, sometimes they fizzle out.[7.73-11.69]If we can make sure it’s the latter, your kid might be fine.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_12466=[0.00-3.04]Having family isn’t easy in this line of work.[3.56-8.14]The late nights, travel, alternate realities threatening their existence.[9.56-10.95]My ex-wife couldn’t take it.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_12469=[0.00-3.75]The light switch is a paranatural item, maybe even an Object of Power.[4.61-9.52]We have verified reports that Alan Wake was in possession of it during the AWE here back in 2010.[9.52-13.18]It definitely has power, we know that much.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_12473=[0.03-0.53]Okay.[2.17-3.10]So what do you need from us?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_12477=[0.08-2.27]I’ve got you covered, so good news there.[2.58-4.84]And we’ll bring our mobile containment unit.[5.22-7.77]It’s specially built for entities like Scratch.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_13439=[0.03-0.58]Okay.[2.17-7.14]This feels like something that once we get the ball rolling, there’s no turning back.[8.36-9.74]Are you sure you have it all figured out?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_13441=[0.00-0.80]Okay, Anderson.[2.81-3.75]Let me know when you are ready.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_13443=[0.21-0.83]Ready to go?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_13445=[0.03-0.87]Okay, Anderson.[2.16-3.37]Just let us know when.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_ESTEVEZ_13447=[0.03-1.14]Okay, Here we go.[2.12-2.81]We’ll be there for you.[2.81-3.58]What do you need from us?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12456=[0.00-2.43]The FBC usually handles stuff like this, right?[3.29-3.99]Any thoughts?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12458=[0.00-1.77]I didn’t know if I could trust you.[3.02-4.20]That was a mistake.[5.52-6.93]So was believing Scratch.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12460=[0.40-1.52]So tell me what I’m missing.[2.14-3.88]The FBC must know something.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12462=[0.00-3.69]Okay, uh, thanks.[5.33-6.15]Go team.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12463=[0.00-1.55]The horror story’s changing reality.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12465=[0.47-2.00]The whole thing is a nightmare.[3.69-6.01]I can’t let my family be torn apart.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12468=[0.03-2.60]Scratch told me the Clicker can be used to change the story.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12470=[0.03-0.98]I can come up with a plan.[1.19-1.81]I always do.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12471=[0.03-1.97]So we need Wake to fix the story, right?[2.41-3.39]That hasn’t changed.[3.94-4.94]So here’s what I have.[5.95-8.67]Wake’s still trapped in the Dark Place, under the lake.[9.52-11.50]I think we can use the Clicker to get him out.[12.34-18.01]But first we need a work of art, something other than his story, and that'll get him here.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12474=[0.03-1.63]I’ll head to Cauldron Lake with the Clicker.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12476=[0.03-2.29]I can tell there’s no talking you out of coming, Casey.[3.49-6.40]Estevez, is there a way to get that light array to the lake?
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_12479=[0.00-1.15]I’ll make some calls on the way.[1.93-3.14]Just meet me at Cauldron Lake.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_13440=[0.00-0.69]Not just yet.[2.02-2.85]Give me a moment.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_13442=[0.00-0.62]I’m ready now.[1.26-1.89]Let’s go.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_13444=[0.00-1.92]No, still working on it.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_13446=[0.05-1.46]I’m ready to head to Cauldron Lake now.[2.22-3.56]Let’s get the plan started.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_23369=[0.00-0.95]But it’s not too late.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_23370=[0.03-1.91]I just need to understand more.
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_23371=[0.00-1.43]It’s made it so my daughter died here,
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_23372=[0.00-1.88]even though she’s supposed to be back home, in Virginia.[3.67-4.69]Do you know if that’s...
GC_RE06_ESTEVEZ_03_SAGA_23373=[0.00-2.01]Does that match your understanding of this thing?
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_ILMO_12495=[0.00-1.21]Jaakko was all heart.[2.41-6.68]He always went along with my ideas, no matter how stupid they were.[6.68-8.50]Always happy to help.[9.29-10.25]I got carried away.[11.25-13.28]I never think things through.[13.85-14.77]It’s my fault.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_ILMO_12497=[0.33-3.48]The Cult is my craziest idea that ever worked.[4.91-7.82]Look, what kind of cult calls themselves a cult?[8.79-9.32]Exactly.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_ILMO_12498=[0.03-2.19]We protect Watery and Bright Falls.[2.49-3.35]We’re the good guys.[4.18-5.94]A secret neighborhood watch.[6.89-9.14]That was the idea anyway...[10.62-13.70]Look, we’ve always known about the horror inside the lake.[15.23-17.73]When any Taken come out, we kill ‘em.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_ILMO_12501=[0.00-2.48]Nothing good has ever come out of Cauldron Lake.[2.99-7.74]The nightmare that hit Bright Falls in 2010 was because of his writing.[8.70-16.12]Ever since then, pages of his stories are floating up from the lake, and monsters keep popping out.[16.28-17.25]It’s all him.[17.44-18.18]Wake.[18.53-21.12]And if we don’t stop him, no one will.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_ILMO_12504=[0.03-3.17]Certain folks around here have always known about Cauldron Lake.[4.27-6.45]Before us, it was the Torchbearers.[6.79-10.41]When I inherited the mission, I wanted to call it a “cult”.[11.07-13.34]It was genius.[14.62-16.15]Just the name did half the work.[16.54-18.79]Made people too scared to go in the woods at night.[19.65-20.76]Business 101.[20.76-23.81]Fear is a great motivator.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_ILMO_12506=[0.00-0.46]Right.[1.06-1.60]Right.[3.22-7.42]I'll round up the gang, whoever’s left.[7.42-10.74]We won't let these fucking monsters hurt any more of our people.[12.20-13.41]We'll do my brother proud.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_ILMO_18032=[0.03-2.25]I’ve never heard of anyone called “Scratch”.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_SAGA_12494=[0.07-1.73]I’m sorry about your brother, Ilmo.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_SAGA_12496=[0.03-6.04]I realize it’s a bad time, but I need you to tell me everything about the Cult of the Tree.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_SAGA_12499=[0.00-4.68]You don’t turn people into Taken, you kill the ones who already have.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_SAGA_12500=[0.00-1.50]You were trying to kill Alan Wake.[2.21-2.64]Why?
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_SAGA_12502=[0.03-2.82]Wake’s evil doppelganger, Scratch, is the threat we’re facing.[3.26-3.89]Not Wake.[4.68-5.89]And I will stop him.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_SAGA_12503=[0.00-1.52]How long has the Cult been around for?
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_SAGA_12505=[0.00-1.62]I’m going to deal with the situation, Ilmo.[2.33-5.08]But the town will need protecting until we sort this out.[6.32-7.18]I could use your help.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_SAGA_12507=[0.00-1.10]Thank you, Ilmo.
GC_RE06_ILMO_01_SAGA_18033=[0.00-1.48]Ilmo blames Wake for all of this.[2.72-4.38]It’s like he doesn’t even know about Scratch.
GC_RE06_WAKE_01_ILMO_12453=[0.00-1.55]Don’t listen to him, Saga!
GC_RE06_WAKE_01_JAAKKO_12454=[0.00-0.51]No, Saga![0.51-1.32]Fucking no!
GC_RE06_WAKE_01_SAGA_12447=[0.00-1.89]You wrote Logan into the story.[2.92-6.12]You told me yourself, from the Dark Place.
GC_RE06_WAKE_01_SAGA_12449=[0.03-1.83]My daughter is dead because of you![2.14-3.27]She’s a child![4.48-6.29]What the fuck is wrong with you?

GC_RE06_WAKE_01_SAGA_12455=[0.00-0.51]Okay.
GC_RE06_WAKE_01_SAGA_24253=Here it is.
GC_RE06_WAKE_01_WAKE_12448=[0.03-2.46]Listen, Scratch is coming.[3.11-4.38]He’s close.[4.81-6.52]He’s almost here, he’s-
GC_RE06_WAKE_01_WAKE_12450=[0.31-1.60]I’m trying to fix this.[2.27-3.43]I will fix this.[4.19-5.16]I’ll save everyone.[5.16-6.34]But we’re running out of time.[6.34-7.45]I need the Clicker.
GC_RE06_WAKE_01_WAKE_12452=[0.19-1.75]Yes, I promise.[2.18-3.40]But we’re out of time.[3.79-4.32]Hurry.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_12576=[0.08-1.89]Tor and Odin went after her, right?[1.98-2.88]Maybe they’ll get her out.[3.59-5.71]With the power of rock and roll.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_12578=[0.14-1.94]I’m immediately less optimistic about this.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_12580=[0.03-3.22]I’ve never seen an entity break a Bureau containment unit like that.[4.20-7.12]And now the Dark Presence is occupying Agent Casey.[9.50-12.92]When it attacked him in the woods, it must have been preparing for this.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_5076=[0.04-2.15]It’s never that simple.[3.20-8.14]But I should have put you in a box and shipped you off to a containment facility the second I laid eyes on you.[10.29-16.07]The only question now is, are you able to fix this?
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_5078=[0.00-2.27]Not the most encouraging answer, but we’ll make it work.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_5080=[0.00-0.44]How?
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_5087=[0.47-2.19]Well, you won’t get very far without these.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_ESTEVEZ_5088=[0.00-2.44]This plan is a real hail mary, Wake.[4.32-6.25]I wish I could help, but this is all on you.[7.66-10.47]I got you every kind of weapon we have available.[12.57-13.71]Don’t fuck it up.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_WAKE_12575=[0.14-5.17]Scratch, the Dark Presence inside Casey, threw Saga into the lake.[5.17-8.10]If she ends up in the Dark Place, she could be there forever.[8.64-10.64]It took me 13 years to get out.[11.05-11.98]Zane never did.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_WAKE_12577=[0.03-1.46]I saw them when I was trapped there.[2.94-4.31]They performed in my musical.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_WAKE_12579=[0.00-1.03]What’s the situation?
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_WAKE_12581=[0.03-1.10]And now he has the Clicker.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_WAKE_5075=[0.03-2.45]I’ll do anything it takes to fix this, Agent Estevez.[3.41-5.08]I’m the reason this is all happening.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_WAKE_5077=[0.07-0.74]I can try.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_WAKE_5079=[0.03-5.18]Scratch will go to Bright Falls and use the Clicker to bring about the horrific ending he wrote for Return.[6.02-7.37]But I can still fix this.
GC_RE07_ESTEVEZ_01_WAKE_5081=[0.03-1.94]Scratch must have the manuscript.[2.37-4.36]If I can read the ending, I can rewrite it.[5.04-6.07]I need to go after him.
GC_RE09_ANDERSONS_01_ODIN_12749=[0.03-2.28]We’ve been performing on Door’s show.[2.56-4.52]We finally buried the hatchet!
GC_RE09_ANDERSONS_01_ODIN_12752=[0.00-2.03]Our time back there is done.[2.73-4.85]But you got this, dear Saga.[5.73-9.05]Ahti has set up a puddle for you to swim out of.[9.71-11.92]Once more with feeling!
GC_RE09_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_12748=[0.00-0.50]First time?
GC_RE09_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_12751=[0.00-1.06]I’m leaving the Dark Place.[2.74-3.53]Come with me.
GC_RE09_ANDERSONS_01_SAGA_12753=[0.03-1.53]I wish we’d gotten more time together.
GC_RE09_ANDERSONS_01_TOR_12747=[0.00-1.56]Glad we caught you, kiddo.[2.49-4.26]We missed you the first time around.
GC_RE09_ANDERSONS_01_TOR_12750=[0.03-2.81]I haven’t buried shit, bro.[3.46-4.96]We’re just helping Tom.
GC_RE09_ANDERSONS_01_TOR_12754=[0.03-1.76]This isn’t goodbye, kiddo.[2.52-8.53]Tom told us not to say anything about what’s coming, but we’ll see each other again.
GC_RE09_TIM_01_SAGA_12737=[0.00-0.96]What happened to you?
GC_RE09_TIM_01_SAGA_12739=[0.07-2.08]I need to get to Parliament Tower Plaza.[2.98-4.51]Do you have any idea where it is?
GC_RE09_TIM_01_SAGA_12742=[0.07-1.23]Can I see that page, Tim?
GC_RE09_TIM_01_SAGA_12745=[0.03-1.58]Who is this Door person?
GC_RE09_TIM_01_SAGA_13055=[0.08-1.65]You met Wake while he was here?
GC_RE09_TIM_01_SAGA_24247=[0.16-1.71]How did you end up in the Dark Place?
GC_RE09_TIM_01_SAGA_24251=[0.47-2.77]I got him out, just before I got thrown in.
GC_RE09_TIM_01_TIM_12738=[0.06-1.17]I was brought here.
GC_RE09_TIM_01_TIM_12740=[0.03-3.06]This place, it’s like trying to find your way around in a dream.[3.96-6.93]I’ve been trying to map it, but it keeps looping and shifting.[7.63-10.98]Like there are many versions stacked on top of each other.
GC_RE09_TIM_01_TIM_12741=[0.07-1.02]But there is a page.[1.66-4.13]It describes Door finding his way through this place.[5.34-8.98]I tried to follow the steps, but no luck.
GC_RE09_TIM_01_TIM_12743=[0.07-0.72]Of course.[1.22-4.51]In fact, it’s the page I tried to give you back in the morgue, in Bright Falls.[5.90-6.33]Huh.[7.24-10.32]Now that I think about it, maybe Door brought me here to keep you from reading it.[12.85-13.24]Here.
GC_RE09_TIM_01_TIM_12744=[0.00-1.37]I’m going to keep looking for Door.[1.77-4.69]The closer I get, the closer I feel to waking up.[5.75-7.29]I need to find the man behind the curtain.
GC_RE09_TIM_01_TIM_12746=[0.00-2.41]He’s here, somewhere.[3.62-5.85]I’ve been seeing his face in my dreams for years.[8.66-10.32]This whole thing is insane.[12.22-14.45]He’s much more than he seems.

GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48635=[0.03-1.80]The Dark Place wouldn’t let me go that way.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48636=[0.03-1.25]The city was not real.[1.96-4.11]I was limited to the confines of the dream.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48637=[0.03-1.97]The story determined where I could go.[2.52-3.51]And where I couldn’t.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48638=[0.03-1.34]There was something hidden here.[2.05-3.12]Light would reveal it.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48639=[0.03-2.00]A phrase repeated over and over.[2.78-4.37]The words resonated with meaning.[4.92-5.93]Had I written this?
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48640=[0.03-1.50]This felt like a bad dream.[2.51-3.78]Could make a good horror story.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48641=[0.00-1.01]There was something here.[2.01-4.43]A broken transmission I couldn’t quite make out.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48642=[0.03-0.87]I had a light now.[1.19-2.90]I could use it to make my way deeper.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48643=[0.00-0.87]The lamp was here.[1.17-2.09]I needed it back.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48644=[0.00-1.42]The bar menu caught my eye.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48645=[0.05-2.54]Someone had barricaded themselves in the room.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48646=[0.03-2.42]The police car felt important to the story.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48647=[0.04-2.00]This door wouldn’t lead to the Grandmaster.[2.78-4.84]This place operated in dream logic.
GEN_IN_ALAN_PICKUPS_WAKE_48960=[0.04-1.41]The Muse was the murder victim.[2.07-4.56]The final scene took place in room 108.

GEN_IN_COMBAT_OVER_WAKE_23536=[0.03-1.96]The shadows faded back into darkness.
GEN_IN_COMBAT_OVER_WAKE_23537=[0.09-1.49]The shadows melted away.[2.02-2.77]I was alone.[3.67-4.32]For now.

GEN_IN_FLANKER_WAKE_23531=[0.03-1.35]My eyes couldn’t follow it.
GEN_IN_FLANKER_WAKE_23532=[0.07-1.82]The shadow moved too fast to see.[2.37-3.25]Where had it gone?

GEN_IN_GUIDANCE_IN05_WAKE_23982=[0.08-1.34]I could use that shotgun.
GEN_IN_GUIDANCE_IN07_WAKE_23983=[0.03-2.32]I would find Alice’s photos in a shoebox.
GEN_IN_GUIDANCE_IN08_WAKE_23984=[0.00-2.24]Alice’s photos were in the talk show basement.[2.69-6.67]I had to bring them to the plaza shoebox in order to enter Parliament Tower.[7.12-9.04]Only then could I finish the story.

GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48592=[0.03-0.75]I need to go back.[1.73-2.78]Got a case to solve.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48593=[0.00-1.27]Back where I started.[2.24-3.57]Like walking through a dream.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48594=[0.00-2.12]This place loops back in on itself.[2.99-4.31]Need to find another way through.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48595=[0.03-1.01]Can’t go that way.[1.59-2.99]The Dark Place won’t let me.

GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48607=[0.03-0.58]Look at that.[1.18-2.06]Another charm.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48608=[0.00-1.57]Charmed, I’m sure.[1.68-1.84]Heh.

GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48610=[0.00-1.25]And another charm.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48611=[0.05-1.43]Ooh, that’s a fun one.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48612=[0.00-2.56]Those pieces of darkness keep bringing the deputies back.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48613=[0.00-3.64]The deputies will just keep coming back unless I destroy those pieces of darkness.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48614=[0.03-0.38]There![1.17-2.91]Next time, they won’t be coming back.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48615=[0.00-0.44]Okay.[1.03-2.43]Now I can stop them for good.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48616=[0.00-0.91]The flooding’s lowered.[1.53-3.91]I should look around, see what the water was hiding.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48617=[0.03-1.58]Cynthia is changing the Overlap.[2.49-3.62]Trying to stop me.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48618=[0.03-1.41]Why isn’t it working?
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48619=[0.03-0.65]Cynthia.[1.59-2.29]She’s here.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48620=[0.00-1.80]There must be a way to get the power back on.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48621=[0.00-2.07]Need to find the generators and get the power back on.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48622=[0.00-1.59]Cynthia’s changed something...
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48623=[0.03-0.81]The water is lower.[1.64-3.57]I can probably reach more parts of the forest now.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48624=[0.00-1.25]How do I activate the lights?
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48625=[0.00-1.37]These must power the light array.[1.75-2.53]Need to find more.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48689=[0.00-2.22]There's definitely something in his chest.[2.68-4.16]Did the killers leave it there?
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48691=[0.00-2.18]Tor and Odin might know something about the Clicker.[2.93-5.25]With Wake out of reach, this is my best lead.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48943=[0.03-4.71]Mom may be gone, but whenever I read this I feel like she's still here.

GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48949=[0.00-1.90]This mug always cheers me up.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_48950=[0.00-3.68]We did bring Wake back from the Dark Place, with the song and the Clicker.[5.02-6.52]But he didn’t end up here, now.[7.88-11.11]He landed on the shore after I faced Nightingale in the overlap.
GEN_RE_SAGA_PICKUPS _SAGA_49320=[0.00-4.15]Casey hates those cheesy crime books, but he really hates the movies.

HARDCODED_HINT_1=While knocked to the ground, use dodge to avoid follow-up attacks. This will also allow you to get back on your feet quicker.
HARDCODED_HINT_2=When overwhelmed by the enemy, look for a Safe Haven. Its healing light prevents the enemy from reaching you.
HARDCODED_HINT_3=Burn an enemy's Darkness Shield away to expose a Source Point. Destroying a Source Point deals devastating damage.
HARDCODED_HINT_4=Dodging away from a Taken Slasher's charge attack at the last moment will result in the enemy stumbling, momentarily incapacitating it.
HARDCODED_HINT_5=Use a Hand Flare to escape the enemy's Grapple unharmed.

LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_1_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17630=[0.00-1.35]It’s a nice looking float, for sure.[2.48-5.48]This’ll be my first Deerfest, so I don’t know what to expect really.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_1_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17632=[0.22-3.89]Well I certainly hope so - I hate the holidays.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_1_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17634=[0.03-2.30]Well I’ve got plans now, by the sound of it.[3.12-4.93]I’ll head straight to the Oh Deer when I wake up.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_1_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17636=[0.03-1.64]Did you see those out-of-towners?[2.39-3.71]I wonder why they’re here.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_1_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17638=[0.03-2.27]At least any more than this flooding already is.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_1_FLOAT_BUILDER_17629=[0.00-8.36]Not to toot my own horn, but I’m pretty darn sure my, er I mean our, float will be the belle of the ball at this year’s Deerfest.[8.73-10.04]Just a few more days!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_1_FLOAT_BUILDER_17631=[0.04-3.74]It is the finest entertainment a town like ours has to offer.[3.95-7.35]The happiest day of the year - like Christmas, but better!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_1_FLOAT_BUILDER_17633=[0.06-2.13]Got any big plans for the day after the festival?[2.75-8.35]It’s known as the ‘staying in and eating your body weight in pancakes’ day around here.[8.75-10.74]You need to recover after all that celebrating.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_1_FLOAT_BUILDER_17635=[0.08-1.71]You won’t be the only one!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_1_FLOAT_BUILDER_17637=[0.94-3.11]Never a good sign to see more law around.[4.21-6.85]I just hope they won’t interfere with the festival!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_1_17639=[0.03-1.31]Any interesting guests lately?[1.98-2.87]Any good finds?
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_1_17644=[0.09-1.98]Not on the surface at least.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_1_17648=[0.03-2.18]Those dishes won’t clean themselves!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_2_17640=[0.10-0.57]Zilch.[0.88-4.03]But someone left a gross surprise under their bed for housekeeping.[4.17-5.61]They went nuts!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_2_17642=[0.03-2.67]Either that or the couple on their honeymoon.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_2_17645=[0.00-1.36]Or in the public eye.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_2_17647=[0.03-3.15]I guess we should get back to work.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_2_17649=[0.03-2.54]Ugh, fuck my life.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_3_17641=[0.04-3.64]So that’s what all that screaming was about?
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_3_17643=[0.00-4.22]When you guys said nothing ever happens in this town, you weren’t kidding.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_3_17646=[0.05-3.65]Okay, I’m going to get back to that one later for sure.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_1_17650=[0.06-3.26]The passage of time is deceiving.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_1_17652=[0.08-3.57]And they end, in the end they end.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_1_17654=[0.03-1.67]So how have you been?[2.25-4.15]I hear things are looking up for you.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_1_17656=[0.76-2.11]How lovely.[2.65-4.24]I’m proud of you.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_1_17659=[0.11-4.38]The light of the stars, the sky where they fly.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_1_17661=[0.03-2.11]Down below we flow.[2.31-4.38]Below we flow.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_2_17651=[0.03-2.53]The days of our lives are fleeting.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_2_17653=[0.03-3.04]And they end, in the end they end.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_2_17655=[0.11-1.64]Oh, thank you![1.67-7.57]Yes, that’s correct - my efforts are being rewarded in abundance.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_2_17657=[0.03-2.12]As am I of you.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_2_17658=[0.03-4.84]The moon and the sun and the circles they run.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PARK-GOER_2_17660=[0.00-2.43]Down below we flow.[2.46-5.07]Below we flow.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_4_CHARLIE_17663=[0.00-5.74]Don’t know, don’t care![8.12-9.04]How much have you had?[9.59-11.60]Not enough, that’s how much![12.31-13.91]Never enough coffee.[14.86-23.52]That rich, bittersweet nectar - get it at Coffee World, get it where you can, get it now!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_4_CHARLIE_17665=[0.00-2.04]Man, it is sweaty in these suits.[2.69-3.20]Isn’t it?[3.95-4.60]Charline?[5.19-6.60]Are you as uncomfortable as I am?
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_4_CHARLIE_17667=[0.03-1.50]I don’t know what you’re talking about.[2.46-3.87]Ugh, I’m in hell.[4.38-5.69]Swamp-ass city.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_4_CHARLIE_17670=[0.00-4.84]Now with ten percent off all your coffee-themed purchases from the gift shop![5.03-6.91]Get your thermoses ready for winter!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_4_CHARLIE_17671=[0.03-1.90]I could use a thermos right now.[2.46-3.85]Drank too much.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_4_CHARLINE_17662=[0.03-2.74]Just how much coffee have you had today, Charlie?
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_4_CHARLINE_17664=[0.00-1.56]Jesus, Charlie.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_4_CHARLINE_17666=[0.00-4.12]You don’t think the amount of hot caffeinated beverages you’ve downed has anything to do with it?
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_4_CHARLINE_17668=[1.01-2.39]Change of topic, please.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_4_CHARLINE_17669=[0.04-1.87]Come to Coffee World![1.90-5.09]The thrills never end, and the coffee never stops pouring!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_4_CHARLINE_17672=[0.94-2.21]You and me both, brother.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_5_STREET_SWEEPER_17673=[0.03-3.95]Who else to keep this city clean if not I?[4.98-9.41]Who else to protect its citizens from the dangers of unsanitary conditions?
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_5_STREET_SWEEPER_17674=[0.03-6.84]Trash, garbage, refuse - call it what you will, I will make it disappear.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_5_STREET_SWEEPER_17675=[0.06-3.55]The world may be drowning in its own waste, but not this town.[4.04-7.57]Not as long as I’m here, guarding the streets, keeping them safe.[8.08-9.89]Keeping them clean!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_5_STREET_SWEEPER_17676=[0.06-3.91]Trash does not belong in your lives nor does it belong on the streets, people!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_6_FEMALE_TOWNIE_17677=[0.03-3.32]So how’s that mystery business of yours going?[3.88-5.42]We missed you at trivia night.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_6_FEMALE_TOWNIE_17679=[0.38-2.87]Stop avoiding the question, Mark.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_6_FEMALE_TOWNIE_17681=[0.06-1.96]And a witch haunting the woods?[2.55-7.88]Yeah, I know the scary stories to keep the kids from falling off cliffs and drowning in lakes.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_6_FEMALE_TOWNIE_17683=[0.00-0.76]Uh-huh.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_6_FEMALE_TOWNIE_17684=[0.03-3.26]So what have you found out in this research of yours?[3.66-7.59]What great mysteries of Bright Falls have you unveiled?
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_6_FEMALE_TOWNIE_17686=[0.95-3.57]I did not know that, actually.[4.32-8.13]It’s clearly some super duper important stuff you’re doing.[8.81-11.18]I guess I can forgive you for missing trivia night.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_6_MALE_TOWNIE_17678=[0.00-0.90]You did?[1.55-2.62]How badly?
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_6_MALE_TOWNIE_17680=[0.03-3.21]You know, I have been up to a little something.[4.44-8.16]You know those urban legends about that cult operating in the woods?
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_6_MALE_TOWNIE_17682=[0.03-2.97]I think there’s more to those stories than they let on.[3.38-7.96]Well, maybe not the witch one, but there’s definitely something going on.[8.61-9.98]And I’m going to figure out what.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_6_MALE_TOWNIE_17685=[0.14-0.57]I...[1.54-4.05]Well, nothing major, yet.[4.56-7.38]But I’m onto some interesting things.[8.02-14.48]Like did you know that the stick figures in the woods are made from a rare aspen that only grows in this area?
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_7_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17687=[0.05-1.65]Tweet tweet, my sweets![2.24-3.96]Heard any good news lately?[4.76-5.50]I’m all ears![6.08-8.21]Ears, and eyes, and limbs and organs.[9.16-10.60]That’s all I am.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_7_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17688=[0.00-0.94]What’s that you say?[2.74-4.21]There’s a change in the air?[5.63-7.23]Some sort of shift?[8.57-11.64]A wrong turn, a point of no return?[12.62-16.66]Yes, my dearies - I feel it too.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_7_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17689=[0.03-3.36]If not for the birds, I might just go a little nutty.[5.14-7.11]A little cuckoo, if you will.[7.24-10.18]Hahaha.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_7_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17690=[0.09-1.90]Now why’d you go and do that?[2.58-6.03]Stomping around like that and scaring the poor little things.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_8_TRAFFIC_COP_17691=[0.03-3.10]A pretty nice day to be working outside.[3.62-5.58]I don’t envy the guys stuck on desk duty.
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_8_TRAFFIC_COP_17692=[0.03-1.78]This is where the action is!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_8_TRAFFIC_COP_17693=[0.00-1.45]Careful crossing the road!
LW_BF_STATE_1_GROUP_8_TRAFFIC_COP_17694=[0.00-3.19]Jaywalking - the bane of my existence.
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_1_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17696=[0.20-1.97]I’m sure we’ll get a nice sunny day.
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_1_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17699=[0.00-0.61]Nope.
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_1_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17701=[0.31-4.21]Well, we’ve got plenty more to do here before we can call it a day.
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_1_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17703=[0.06-1.20]Jeez, Louise.
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_1_FLOAT_BUILDER_17695=[0.09-2.99]How about that weather forecast for Deerfest?[3.33-5.51]I’ve been working on this float for a month straight.[5.51-7.38]If it rains, I am going to lose it.[7.95-9.68]It’ll ruin all the paper maché![10.44-11.89]That shit is delicate!
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_1_FLOAT_BUILDER_17697=[0.05-3.59]Oh, so now you’re a mentoro- erm, metero- uh...[3.59-4.24]weather man?
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_1_FLOAT_BUILDER_17698=[0.00-2.19]Did you hear something, over by the Sheriff’s Station?
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_1_FLOAT_BUILDER_17700=[0.00-2.25]It better not have anything to do with Deerfest.[3.35-5.68]They need to keep their messes out of my festival.
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_1_FLOAT_BUILDER_17702=[0.09-1.00]Tell me about it![1.52-3.25]My float’s not even finished.[3.38-4.53]So much to do still![4.53-5.53]So much stress![5.96-7.61]So close to Deerfest!
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_3_17704=[1.15-4.17]Rinse and repeat, clock out, get a beer.[5.28-6.32]Or maybe three.
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_2_HOTEL_WORKER_3_17705=[0.07-3.68]I don’t know if coming to this town was the best idea.[4.85-6.97]“Bright Falls, bright future”.[7.67-8.47]Yeah, right.
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_3_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17706=[0.03-5.01]It’s so quiet here now that Hubert and Hester flew over the rainbow bridge.[6.49-8.07]Do you fellas ever miss them?[9.78-11.52]Do you miss your parents?[12.97-14.02]I know I do.
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_3_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17707=[0.15-3.04]Remember to have some sustenance, my little ones![3.58-5.86]It’ll keep you warm and full of energy.[6.65-9.25]It’ll keep you soaring in the sky.[10.36-12.65]You don’t want to plummet down to the ground.[13.13-13.80]Trust me.[14.63-16.66]It’s not nice down here.[17.63-19.37]Much better in the clouds.
LW_BF_STATE_2_GROUP_3_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17708=[0.05-4.38]A life lived with the birds is not for the birds.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_1_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_1_17709=[0.03-1.81]I swear I brought my full kit along.[3.93-8.35]Jules, you didn’t forget to pack the EMF reader, did you?
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_1_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_1_17711=[0.04-0.56]Great.[1.23-5.79]Now how am I supposed to measure the energy signatures emitted by paranormal manifestations?
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_1_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_1_17714=[0.00-2.22]Not before I find my frigging EMF reader.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_1_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_1_17717=[0.07-2.40]I’m glad you two are enjoying the views.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_1_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_2_17710=[0.03-1.61]Why would I pack your gear?[1.91-3.45]I’ve got my own to worry about.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_1_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_2_17713=[0.03-1.43]We should check the town out first.[1.76-4.43]You know, do research, interview some locals.[4.93-6.37]Get the feel of the place.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_1_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_2_17715=[0.19-2.52]I’m getting some good establishing shots here.[3.24-8.45]Capturing the ‘charming small town with a dark undercurrent beneath the surface’ vibes.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_1_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_3_17712=[0.03-2.80]I can’t wait to hit the haunts!
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_1_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_3_17716=[0.04-6.44]“Bright Falls” - even the name brings to mind a deceptively idyllic place.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_2_WOMAN_ON_THE_PHONE_17718=[0.07-0.52]I know.[1.59-4.08]What was she even doing out there?[4.59-6.37]And at that time of night?
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_2_WOMAN_ON_THE_PHONE_17719=[0.52-2.36]She was what?[3.41-4.59]Digging at what?[4.69-7.45]I’m telling you that woman’s not all there.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_2_WOMAN_ON_THE_PHONE_17720=[0.06-3.43]Next you’ll be telling me you saw her climb up the tree like a squirrel.[3.76-5.66]You know, to hide her food.[6.10-7.24]‘Cause she’s nuts![7.24-9.04]Ha ha.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_2_WOMAN_ON_THE_PHONE_17721=[0.04-6.31]I have a half a mind to join you next time on that midnight run of yours, just so I could see what she’s up to![6.77-7.95]With her half a mind.[7.95-8.46]Ha ha!
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_2_WOMAN_ON_THE_PHONE_17722=[0.27-3.23]Okay, I guess I should go, got work to do.[4.06-7.81]Or maybe I’ll grab a quick coffee from the diner.[8.38-9.85]See Rose in action.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_2_WOMAN_ON_THE_PHONE_17723=[0.05-4.12]I could even ask her about it, on the sly, you know?[4.44-6.15]I doubt she’d even notice anything.[7.00-7.62]Hmm.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_3_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17724=[0.05-0.53]Oh no.[0.53-1.92]Oh no oh no.[2.11-4.20]What will become of my birds now?[4.64-5.58]Where will they go?[5.95-7.57]Who will feed them?
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_3_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17725=[0.26-0.98]Fly away![1.12-2.44]Find a happier place.[2.69-3.86]Go while you still can!
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_3_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17726=[0.08-2.50]And what about old Margaret?[3.16-4.32]Where will I go?[5.39-8.44]Who will I look after when all my little friends are gone?
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_3_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17727=[0.03-0.93]It’s too late.[1.43-2.64]Too late for my birds.[3.16-4.29]Too late for me.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_4_TRAFFIC_COP_17728=[0.05-2.37]Got to remember to buy stuff for taco night.[2.99-4.13]Hot sauce.[4.68-5.60]Extra hot.[6.33-7.60]Show Pete who’s who.
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_4_TRAFFIC_COP_17729=[0.00-1.55]Watch out for the Deerfest prep work!
LW_BF_STATE_4_GROUP_4_TRAFFIC_COP_17730=[0.00-1.53]Hope it won’t rain on our parade.
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_1_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17731=[0.03-2.38]They all flew away.[3.48-4.99]Into the skies.[6.78-8.47]Into the darkness.
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_1_BIRD_FEEDING_LADY_17733=[0.04-2.14]I need to find my friends again.[3.58-4.97]They’ve all gone missing.[6.35-8.12]They’ve all left me.
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_1_FISHERMAN_17732=[0.04-3.44]All this brouhaha is not good for my old ticker.[4.19-5.79]Or the fishes for that matter.[6.51-7.94]Scares them right off.
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_1_FISHERMAN_17734=[0.10-2.15]I wouldn’t go looking right now.[2.80-4.14]They’ll turn up eventually.[4.85-6.64]Like dead fish in the water.
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_2_WORRIED_TOWNIE_2_17735=[0.03-1.84]My goodness![1.84-2.97]What happened here?
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_2_WORRIED_TOWNIE_2_17736=[0.03-2.14]They’ve marred a local landmark![2.90-4.77]A piece of Bright Falls heritage!
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_2_WORRIED_TOWNIE_2_17737=[0.34-2.54]I bet it’s those young staff members.[3.09-4.55]Bunch of hooligans!
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_3_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17739=[0.05-1.29]It’s probably nothing.
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_3_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17741=[0.09-2.58]We better hurry if we want to get this done before dark.
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_3_FLOAT_BUILDER_17738=[0.00-2.33]What was all that commotion by the old lodge?
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_3_FLOAT_BUILDER_17740=[1.03-2.45]Didn’t sound like nothing to me.
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_3_FLOAT_BUILDER_17742=[0.00-1.45]Yeah, yeah.[2.51-6.18]I bet it’s something to do with those Federal Agents, the ruckus at the motel.[6.74-8.31]I knew they were a bad sign.
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_4_STATUE-TALKER_17743=[0.04-1.08]Hear that?[3.10-7.80]A lot of noise, a lot of running around.
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_4_STATUE-TALKER_17744=[0.13-2.53]I remember when you were still here.[3.47-6.83]Standing tall, statuesque.[8.08-9.34]On your pedestal.[11.20-15.27]Now you’re gone, and these plants are all that’s left.[17.59-19.69]They’ll wither and die some day too.
LW_BF_STATE_5_GROUP_4_STATUE-TALKER_17745=[0.11-2.09]Have you noticed how everyone leaves?[3.07-3.80]In the end?[5.13-6.35]And then it’ll be just...[7.47-8.08]me.[9.14-11.77]It would be nice to have something that stays.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_1_STATUE-TALKER_17747=[0.00-2.10]You remember how it went the last time?[3.11-4.93]The sacrifices we made?[5.61-6.50]The pain?
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_1_STATUE-TALKER_17748=[0.00-1.35]It’s happening again.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_1_STATUE-TALKER_17749=[0.04-2.27]We learned from the last time, didn’t we?[3.30-6.78]Fought our way through it, held fast.[8.29-9.55]And now look at us![10.49-12.07]As thick as thieves.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_1_STATUE-TALKER_17751=[0.15-4.09]I’m sure whatever’s coming is going to be a cakewalk.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_2_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_1_17753=[0.07-2.25]She wouldn’t just wander off and not tell us.[2.80-4.80]Especially after all the weirdness at the lodge.[5.57-6.53]I’m worried, Jules.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_2_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_1_17756=[0.05-1.26]You didn’t have to come![2.41-5.78]It’s not my fault we got caught in the middle of an active occurrence.[6.34-8.94]Look, we just need to find Marcie.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_2_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_1_17759=[0.08-3.68]If we canvas the woods, we’re sure to find some tracks or something.[4.29-5.77]Some hints to her whereabouts.[6.31-8.10]We can even use some of our equipment!
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_2_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_2_17755=[0.00-1.73]Well I’m fucking worried too.[2.24-7.12]You just had to follow some stupid internet rumors and ‘solve the riddle of Bright Falls’.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_2_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_2_17758=[0.09-6.63]Okay, one of us needs to stay at the lodge in case Marcie shows up and the other one should go out looking for her.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_2_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_2_17760=[0.03-2.85]This is not the time to geek out over the stupid gear, Riley.[3.33-5.10]It’s all toys anyway.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_3_FEMALE_MAINTENANCE_WORKER_17762=[0.04-4.84]Those people just burst in here and expect others to clean up after them.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_3_FEMALE_MAINTENANCE_WORKER_17764=[0.07-3.52]They think they’re so mysterious with their ridiculous masks.[3.91-5.36]Children in costumes.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_4_FISHING_TOWNSMAN_17767=[1.53-5.30]Well, at least the fishes are biting again.[5.81-9.78]They didn’t like all that hubbub earlier, poor things.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_4_FISHING_TOWNSMAN_17769=[0.00-2.93]Good thing that the flooding’s done away with too.[4.09-5.98]It’s like the water is in a better mood.[7.36-8.81]And so am I!
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_5_SUPPLY_LOADER_1_17771=[0.03-2.77]So what do you think that whole thing at the lodge was about?
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_5_SUPPLY_LOADER_1_17773=[0.05-3.72]Ah, so you do know something after all.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_5_SUPPLY_LOADER_1_17774=[0.12-5.68]You know, I bet that biker gang from the next town over had something to do with what went on at the lodge.[6.30-8.63]Rowdy folks, rowdy habits.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_5_SUPPLY_LOADER_2_17772=[0.03-0.86]I don’t think.[1.98-3.81]It’s better not to get mixed up with that bunch.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_5_SUPPLY_LOADER_2_17775=[0.03-1.14]I wouldn’t put it past them.[1.80-4.42]Watery definitely has that kind of a rep.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_6_MALE_MAINTENANCE_WORKER_17776=[0.00-5.03]Okey dokey, I don’t like the sounds coming from the station.
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_6_MALE_MAINTENANCE_WORKER_17777=[0.03-5.09]I’ve seen some crazy things in my life, but I don’t know...
LW_BF_STATE_6_GROUP_6_MALE_MAINTENANCE_WORKER_17778=[0.11-3.50]Alright, last scraps and then I’m calling it a day.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_1_CURIOUS_BYSTANDER_1_17779=[0.00-1.96]Anybody see what all that commotion was about?
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_1_CURIOUS_BYSTANDER_1_17785=[0.03-1.14]Oh I’ve noticed.[1.58-4.51]I notice a lot of fishiness, believe me.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_1_CURIOUS_BYSTANDER_1_17787=[0.00-2.68]Ooh, I love a good firework display!
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_1_CURIOUS_BYSTANDER_2_17780=[0.03-0.53]Who knows?[0.64-2.72]If it’s not one thing, it’s the other.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_1_CURIOUS_BYSTANDER_2_17784=[0.00-0.48]Yep.[0.90-4.10]A lot of fishy stuff happening around here recently.[4.68-5.64]Haven’t you noticed?
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_1_CURIOUS_BYSTANDER_2_17788=[0.03-1.39]Or maybe it’s lasers![1.68-3.02]That’d be so cool.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_1_CURIOUS_BYSTANDER_3_17781=[0.05-2.67]I think they’ve got the Koskela brothers locked up in there.[3.35-4.87]I saw them go in earlier.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_1_CURIOUS_BYSTANDER_3_17783=[0.00-3.23]Whatever all that was about, it sounded real fishy to me.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_1_FISHING_TOWNSMAN_17782=[0.22-1.22]Oh dear.[1.94-5.89]Probably got them for what happened to poor Mocha the Moose.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_1_FISHING_TOWNSMAN_17786=[0.06-3.73]Maybe they’re practicing for a light show for Deerfest in there?[4.45-6.25]You know, like a surprise?
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_2_BACKLOT_ONLOOKER_1_17789=[0.09-2.16]I’m still seeing spots from those lights![2.19-3.89]What the heck was that about?
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_2_BACKLOT_ONLOOKER_1_17793=[0.00-0.74]Now, now.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_2_BACKLOT_ONLOOKER_3_17791=[0.03-3.38]Every time something exciting happens in this town, I miss it.[4.01-4.94]Darn it.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_2_BACKLOT_ONLOOKER_3_17794=[0.00-3.10]You guys want to stick around and see if something springs up again?
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_2_WOMAN_ON_THE_PHONE_17790=[0.00-1.48]Can anybody see inside?[1.48-3.72]Are they still there?
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_2_WOMAN_ON_THE_PHONE_17792=[1.10-1.87]It’s those feds.[2.30-4.05]They brought trouble with them.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_3_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17796=[0.00-1.58]I’m sure it’ll be fine.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_3_ASSISTANT_FLOAT_BUILDER_17800=[0.03-0.64]Whoa.[0.71-1.65]Are you okay?
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_3_FLOAT_BUILDER_17795=[0.03-2.47]I don’t like all this chaos right before Deerfest.[3.76-7.45]Maybe I should just stay here for the night and make sure no harm comes to my creation.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_3_FLOAT_BUILDER_17797=[0.06-0.93]What do you know![1.50-2.82]You’re just an apprentice.[3.39-7.10]You have no idea the pressures a professional like me is under!
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_3_FLOAT_BUILDER_17799=[0.03-4.18]If one more thing goes wrong I swear to fucking god...
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_3_FLOAT_BUILDER_17801=[0.00-1.61]Just keep working, will you.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_4_HOTEL_GUEST_17804=[0.00-0.68]It’s empty.[1.83-3.51]There’s nothing there.[3.56-5.10]Just darkness.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_4_HOTEL_GUEST_17806=[0.03-1.88]I don’t want to do this anymore.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_4_HOTEL_GUEST_17807=[0.03-1.26]I want to go home.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_5_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_1_17811=[0.05-3.21]Uh, I think you may be right.[4.37-5.98]Might’ve been a mistake to come here.[7.72-9.72]I don’t think Marcie’s coming back.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_5_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_1_17813=[0.03-0.69]I know.[3.09-4.05]I’m sorry.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_5_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_1_17816=[0.06-2.87]Well, we better be heading out.[3.98-6.00]Nothing left for us here anymore.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_5_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_1_17819=[0.03-0.78]I hope so.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_5_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_2_17812=[0.00-0.83]Fuck, Riley.[1.26-2.59]This is so messed up.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_5_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_2_17815=[0.05-2.63]Hey, it’s not your fault.[3.31-5.21]We all knew what we were signing up for.
LW_BF_STATE_7_GROUP_5_GHOST_HUNTING_TOURIST_2_17818=[0.55-1.14]Agreed.[2.37-4.70]Who knows, maybe she’ll come and haunt us sometime?

LW_MOTEL_STATE_4_GROUP_2_OLD_FRIEND_3_18294=[0.00-2.07]The stuffed moose and squirrels one!
LW_MOTEL_STATE_4_GROUP_2_OLD_FRIEND_3_18297=[0.04-2.66]For that amount of money you’ll cause it yourself.
LW_MOTEL_STATE_4_GROUP_3_BARTENDER_18299=[0.00-0.72]Hi, welcome.
LW_MOTEL_STATE_4_GROUP_4_QUIRKY_TOWNIE_18300=[0.00-0.49]Hello?
LW_MOTEL_STATE_4_GROUP_4_QUIRKY_TOWNIE_18301=[0.00-1.07]Hel-loooo!
LW_MOTEL_STATE_5_GROUP_1_HOTEL_CLERK_18303=[0.10-2.67]No, I mean, yes...[4.00-7.95]I didn’t get any kind of a look, actually.[9.84-13.48]I wasn’t exactly at my post when it all went down.[13.48-17.51]I, uh, I needed to answer nature’s call-[17.51-22.32]and got old Terry from the back there to cover for me.[22.39-25.49]I might’ve taken more time than I should have.[26.50-28.62]It’s usually so quiet around here at that time of day-[28.62-29.99]I didn’t think anything of it!
LW_MOTEL_STATE_5_GROUP_1_HOTEL_CLERK_18305=[0.09-7.58]Well you know, when I heard all the shouting and things breaking and gunfire, I...[9.09-10.13]I stayed where I was.[10.81-13.57]What better place to hide than the john, right?
LW_MOTEL_STATE_5_GROUP_1_HOTEL_CLERK_18307=[0.00-2.12]Poor Terry though.[3.79-5.26]He must be scarred for life![5.29-9.91]I haven’t seen him since the attack, I think he ran for it.[10.39-11.06]Smart.
LW_MOTEL_STATE_5_GROUP_1_LW_FBC_AGENT_18302=[0.00-2.27]And you say you didn’t get a good look at the assailants?
LW_MOTEL_STATE_5_GROUP_1_LW_FBC_AGENT_18304=[0.03-2.79]And exactly where were you when the attack was in progress?
LW_MOTEL_STATE_5_GROUP_1_LW_FBC_AGENT_18306=[0.00-0.89]We’ll look into it.
LW_MOTEL_STATE_5_GROUP_2_QUIRKY_TOWNIE_18308=[0.00-0.74]Hello?!
LW_MOTEL_STATE_5_GROUP_2_QUIRKY_TOWNIE_18309=[0.04-1.64]Heeeelloooo!
LW_MOTEL_STATE_6_GROUP_1_BARTENDER_18310=[0.07-0.83]Oh, hello there.
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_MANDY-MAY_16500=[0.04-3.49]I knew those Andersons were making trouble again.[3.98-6.05]Where are those two anyway?[6.34-9.36]They should be here cleaning up their mess.
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_MANDY-MAY_16502=[0.04-2.88]Well if it wasn’t them, then who?[3.25-4.64]Hoodlums?
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_MANDY-MAY_16505=[0.03-2.64]Oh, who knows with that girl.[3.17-6.84]I always see her running off in the middle of the night.
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_MANDY-MAY_16507=[0.00-0.34]Hmph.[0.93-5.36]A lady should be in bed with her Christie novels at that hour.
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_MANDY-MAY_16510=[0.07-1.58]Oh hush.[2.44-4.59]This is how it looks every day.
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_NORMAN_16501=[0.19-3.36]I saw them pulling out their old music gear.[3.71-6.68]But I don’t think they did all this.
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_NORMAN_16503=[0.13-0.75]Maybe.
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_NORMAN_16504=[0.00-2.16]Where do you think Rose got to?
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_NORMAN_16506=[0.43-1.23]Good for her![1.41-3.33]Life live while you can!
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_NORMAN_16508=[0.00-1.15]Boo![1.18-3.04]Don’t be so old-fashioned.
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_NORMAN_16509=[0.00-3.50]Your hair is looking nice today, Mandy-May.
LW_NH_COMMON_ROOM_NORMAN_16511=[0.03-2.59]Then it looks nice every day.
LW_NH_DONNAS_ROOM_DONNA_16492=[0.03-1.94]Mom’s banana bread recipe.[2.32-11.42]In a medium-sized bowl, smash five ripe bananas and mix with one stick of melted butter, two eggs, and one cup of sugar.
LW_NH_DONNAS_ROOM_DONNA_16493=[0.00-6.69]In a larger bowl, mix two cups of all-purpose flour with one teaspoon of baking soda.[6.92-8.21]Soda, not powder.[8.97-11.32]Pour the banana mixture into the large bowl.[11.69-12.79]Mix thoroughly.
LW_NH_DONNAS_ROOM_DONNA_16494=[0.03-3.51]Once mixed, pour the batter into two greased loaf pans.[3.82-6.85]Bake about one hour at 350 degrees Fahrenheit.[7.18-9.64]The bread is done when a toothpick comes out clean.[9.96-13.05]Enjoy a slice with margarine or peanut butter.
LW_NH_DONNAS_ROOM_DONNA_16495=[0.00-3.40]When examining your car’s engine for problems, start with the big three.[3.71-6.23]Bad fuel mixture, no spark, or low compression.
LW_NH_DONNAS_ROOM_DONNA_16496=[0.36-5.92]Issues with the air/fuel mixture are most commonly caused by a clogged intake valve,[6.03-10.23]a problem in the fuel injection system, or impurities in the fuel itself.
LW_NH_DONNAS_ROOM_DONNA_16497=[0.03-6.50]Lack of spark is caused by faulty spark plugs, wires, or ignition timing.
LW_NH_DONNAS_ROOM_DONNA_16498=[0.03-6.96]Low compression is usually caused by worn piston rings, leaks in the intake or exhaust valves,[7.11-9.13]or a hole in the cylinder head.
LW_NH_DONNAS_ROOM_DONNA_16499=[0.04-6.30]But while these three problems are the usual suspects for engine failure, they’re not the only ones.[6.72-10.76]Crankshafts, valve timing, dead batteries, oil levels,[10.93-15.19]and numerous other faults can be the reason your car isn’t starting.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_1_MALE_RECEPTIONIST_18311=[0.04-1.68]I’ll be right with you, sir.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_1_MALE_RECEPTIONIST_18314=[0.06-2.15]Sir, some patience, please.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_1_MAN_IN_LINE_18312=[0.00-0.52]Yep, yep.[0.85-2.41]Just here to pay my ticket.[2.60-4.67]Whenever you’re ready to take my money.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_1_MAN_IN_LINE_18313=[0.00-1.88]No speeding happening here, I see.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_2_LW_DEPUTY_1_18315=[0.07-4.48]As you know, the investigation is being taken over by the federal agents.[5.09-7.23]Sheriff Breaker wants us to cooperate fully.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_2_LW_DEPUTY_1_18317=[0.04-1.34]I’m being serious, Nelson.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_2_LW_DEPUTY_1_18319=[0.00-2.05]This line of work is not for the faint of heart.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_2_LW_DEPUTY_1_18322=[0.00-0.83]Hrhh.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_2_LW_DEPUTY_1_18323=[0.00-0.56]Agent.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_2_LW_DEPUTY_2_18316=[0.00-1.24]Aye aye, ma’am.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_2_LW_DEPUTY_2_18318=[0.00-4.78]I don’t know about you folks, but I don’t care for all these gruesome murders-[4.78-7.98]and whatnot right here in our wholesome little town.[8.52-10.40]It’s not what I signed up for.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_2_LW_DEPUTY_2_18320=[0.00-0.80]Faint of...[1.53-2.16]Bah ha!
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_2_LW_DEPUTY_3_18321=[0.03-2.94]Are we done with all this official business yet?[3.28-5.75]I have a breakfast bagel waiting for me.
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PROTESTING_PRISONER_18324=[0.00-1.64]They locked up an innocent man!
LW_STATION_STATE_1_GROUP_3_PROTESTING_PRISONER_18325=[0.04-1.63]I swear I didn’t do anything![3.84-5.69]They’re a lying bunch of bastards.[6.70-7.81]You believe me, right?
LW_STATION_STATE_2_GROUP_1_FEMALE_RECEPTIONIST_18327=[0.03-1.65]Uh, just a moment, ma’am.[1.96-3.42]Someone will be right with you.
LW_STATION_STATE_2_GROUP_1_LAWYER_18326=[0.06-2.45]My client has been held here long enough.[3.33-4.82]Are you going to let me speak to them or not?
LW_STATION_STATE_2_GROUP_2_ARRESTING_OFFICER_18328=[0.07-2.33]How many times do we have to do this, Walter?[2.79-5.41]I’m at my wit’s end with you!
LW_STATION_STATE_2_GROUP_2_ARRESTING_OFFICER_18329=[0.10-2.65]Do you think I like throwing you in jail every other day?[3.84-5.17]No, I don’t![5.17-8.31]Do you have any idea how much paperwork you’re causing me?[8.55-9.33]It’s a lot!
LW_STATION_STATE_2_GROUP_2_ARRESTING_OFFICER_18330=[0.07-2.31]You can sit here and stew for a while.[2.77-4.60]Think about your life choices, buddy.[6.31-7.56]Is it really worth this?
LW_STATION_STATE_2_GROUP_3_PROTESTING_PRISONER_18331=[0.03-0.82]I want out![1.24-3.92]Something bad’s going down, I can feel it.[4.49-5.41]Let me out!
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_1_LW_DEPUTY_1_18333=[0.03-1.82]Let’s not assume the worst of our colleagues.
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_1_LW_DEPUTY_2_18332=[0.03-3.25]Mulligan and Thornton told everyone to stay out of the basement,[3.47-6.34]and now they're nowhere to be found.[7.05-8.90]I bet they're just trying to get out of work.
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_1_LW_DEPUTY_2_18334=[0.00-2.00]Yeah, god forbid.
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_2_WORRIED_TOWNIE_1_18335=[0.03-3.72]Make sure to write down that he’s never done this before.[4.46-7.05]He always comes home right after work.[7.29-9.72]Or at least calls to let me know he’ll be late.
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_2_WORRIED_TOWNIE_1_18336=[0.16-2.42]I just know something has happened to him.[3.44-5.93]It’s not like him to disappear like this.
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_3_ANGRY_TOWNIE_18337=[0.00-2.13]How many times do I have to tell you?[2.46-4.63]She’s gone missing!
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_3_ANGRY_TOWNIE_18339=[0.00-0.82]Why would she do that?[0.82-2.68]I’m a lovely person!
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_3_MALE_RECEPTIONIST_18338=[0.04-2.97]Are you sure she’s just not avoiding your calls?
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_4_SLEEPING_PRISONER_18340=[0.13-1.93]The eye in the sky...[2.41-3.81]I don’t like it.[4.39-5.50]It’s staring at me.

LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_4_SLEEPING_PRISONER_18342=[0.32-1.11]It sees me.[1.94-3.48]It’s coming for me from the dark.[3.48-4.01]It’s coming!
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_5_CONCERNED_PRISONER_1_18343=[0.00-2.24]He’s a little cuckoo, right?
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_5_CONCERNED_PRISONER_1_18345=[0.00-2.99]What the heck is the eye he keeps talking about?
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_5_CONCERNED_PRISONER_1_18347=[1.32-3.09]Better let sleeping dogs lie.
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_5_CONCERNED_PRISONER_2_18344=[0.08-2.65]More than a little.
LW_STATION_STATE_4_GROUP_5_CONCERNED_PRISONER_2_18346=[0.03-2.14]I don’t think I wanna know.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17839=[0.00-5.45]They say if sauna doesn’t fix what ails you, you’re a goner.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17841=[0.35-2.35]Have you heard old Pat’s radio show lately?[3.38-6.26]I fear he’s losing his grip on reality.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17843=[0.59-3.54]Sure is nice out here by the water.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_2_17840=[0.05-2.07]They also say silence is golden.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_2_17842=[1.16-3.59]I don’t care to listen to pointless jibber-jabber.[4.89-7.05]Not on the radio, and not in the sauna.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_2_17844=[0.06-1.17]Nice and quiet.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_2_DOCKWORKER_1_17845=[0.97-4.04]What did you used to say your dream job was as a kid?[4.46-6.72]I bet it wasn’t dockworker?
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_2_DOCKWORKER_1_17849=[0.00-2.68]I’m supervising the work.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_2_DOCKWORKER_1_17851=[0.00-1.94]And it’s super.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_2_DOCKWORKER_1_17853=[0.04-1.20]Language!
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_2_DOCKWORKER_2_17846=[0.04-5.91]I don’t know about all that, but “idle hands are the devil’s playground” so...
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_2_DOCKWORKER_2_17848=[0.03-1.84]Mind giving me a hand and helping out?
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_2_FISHER_17847=[0.05-3.32]Well us fishing types appreciate you all, at least.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_2_FISHER_17850=[0.00-1.15]And?
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_2_FISHER_17852=[0.00-2.21]This darn flooding’s a real pain in the butt.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_3_SAD_OLD_BIKER_17854=[0.21-3.45]Where has the time gone?
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_3_SAD_OLD_BIKER_17855=[0.04-3.96]There’s just a wretched husk of what used to be me left.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_3_SAD_OLD_BIKER_17856=[0.05-3.49]They say being old is just a state of mind.[4.13-6.65]I’d like to give them a  piece of my mind.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_3_SAD_OLD_BIKER_17857=[0.00-3.88]Whoever said these were the golden years was full of it.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_3_SAD_OLD_BIKER_17858=[0.23-4.44]Too old to ride my bike, too slow to hit the road.[5.24-6.77]What’s the use.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_4_BOAT_OWNER_17859=[0.12-3.47]Oh you rascal, what’ve you been up to this time around?[4.15-7.03]There’s only so many times I can keep fixing the same hole.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_4_BOAT_OWNER_17860=[0.11-1.73]How’d she get loose from the mooring?[2.70-4.37]I hitched her up so securely.[4.37-6.89]I swear this vessel has a mind of its own.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_4_BOAT_OWNER_17861=[0.12-3.71]Why would you want to sail away from me anyway, old boatie?[4.62-5.80]Don’t you like me?[6.81-7.64]I like you.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_5_CAMPAIGN_WORKER_17862=[0.04-3.75]A vote for Mayor Setter is a vote for everyone.[4.07-5.15]For Watery!

LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_5_CAMPAIGN_WORKER_17864=[0.03-1.44]I love it when these rhyme.
LW_WA_STATE_1_GROUP_5_CAMPAIGN_WORKER_17865=[0.03-5.34]Mayor Setter will sit in office and stand up for justice!
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17866=[0.90-6.57]All that’s missing here is a cold beer and a fresh 'vihta'.
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17868=[0.04-4.48]Ah that’s fine, I’ve got to keep you company.
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17869=[0.00-3.58]Have you noticed Blum doesn’t join us for sauna anymore?
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17871=[0.03-2.70]“A joy shared is a joy doubled.[2.76-3.47]I heard that somewhere.
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17873=[0.03-0.53]Oh.[1.55-2.14]I see.
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_2_17867=[0.03-2.58]Well, why don’t you go over there and grab some birch branches?[3.03-4.02]Make yourself one.
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_2_17870=[1.33-3.84]Smart guy, always liked him.
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_2_17872=[0.07-3.65]Well, “It is only in solitude that I ever find my own core".
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_2_SAD_OLD_BIKER_17874=[0.04-2.21]I used to be a real troublemaker.[3.18-5.91]Now I’m lucky if I can make number two.
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_2_SAD_OLD_BIKER_17875=[0.03-2.11]This town ain’t what it used to be, either.[2.78-5.43]Rundown, on its last legs.[6.25-7.34]Like me.
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_2_SAD_OLD_BIKER_17876=[0.00-1.68]Guess I should head back home.[2.81-4.52]Time for supper!
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_3_CAMPAIGN_WORKER_17877=[0.10-6.79]Contrary to outrageous rumors, Mayor Setter does not harm cats![7.29-10.25]He loves our feline friends.[10.43-14.11]If anything, he might snuggle them to death.
LW_WA_STATE_2_GROUP_3_CAMPAIGN_WORKER_17878=[0.04-4.59]Jim Figamore would have you believe horrible things about his opponent.[5.17-7.89]But he is all bark, no bite.[8.61-10.16]Unlike Mayor Setter!

LW_WA_STATE_3_GROUP_1_CHARLINE_17884=[0.00-3.16]You mean something that didn’t include wearing stupid costumes-[3.20-6.83]for a creepy old amusement park in the craphole town that time forgot?
LW_WA_STATE_3_GROUP_1_CHARLINE_17886=[0.03-2.56]Any job would be better than this.[3.06-4.16]And any town.[4.89-8.86]When my piggy bank is full enough, I’m hitting the road so hard.
LW_WA_STATE_3_GROUP_1_CHARLINE_17888=[0.03-0.61]I know.[1.50-2.72]Don’t tell him I said that.
LW_WA_STATE_3_GROUP_2_DOCKWORKER_2_17889=[0.03-3.21]Well, at least the flooding’s gone down.
LW_WA_STATE_3_GROUP_2_DOCKWORKER_2_17892=[0.00-0.80]You kidding?[1.75-5.20]Watery is the safest, most boring town in the world.
LW_WA_STATE_3_GROUP_2_FISHER_17890=[0.48-1.00]Yeah.[1.15-3.18]But the fish aren’t biting any better.
LW_WA_STATE_3_GROUP_2_FISHER_17891=[0.06-4.33]You know, you really shouldn’t be out here by yourself this late.
LW_WA_STATE_3_GROUP_2_FISHER_17893=[0.79-2.46]I wish that was the case.

LW_WA_STATE_3_GROUP_3_WATERY_TOWNIE_17895=[0.03-0.83]I loved it![0.97-3.73]I had a half a mind to come down and start dancing.

LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_1_BOAT_OWNER_17901=[0.05-2.87]Wonder how many people talk to their boats.
LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_2_SUOMI_HALL_TOWNIE_17902=[0.03-2.74]I hear some concerning things over from Bright Falls.
LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_2_SUOMI_HALL_TOWNIE_17904=[0.03-2.70]I thought small towns like ours were supposed to be safe.
LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_2_SUOMI_HALL_TOWNIE_17905=[0.03-2.09]I’ve been thinking we need a neighborhood watch.[2.42-6.13]Keep incidents like the one in Bright Falls from happening around here.
LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_2_SUOMI_HALL_TOWNIE_17907=[0.00-1.06]Yes, well.[1.06-4.98]I think the Kalevala Knights might be too busy with, uh, their own stuff.[5.14-6.26]Bikes and such.
LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_2_TOWN_GOSSIP_17903=[0.00-1.72]You mean that horrible affair at the lodge?[2.30-5.28]Why is everyone running around shooting at everything nowadays?

LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_3_CHARLIE_17911=[0.05-1.92]Alright, it’s settled then.[3.10-5.02]After Moosefest, we’re quitting.
LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_3_CHARLIE_17913=[0.00-0.84]Yeah![1.06-2.94]Screw Coffee World.[3.10-4.57]Screw dad!
LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_3_CHARLIE_17916=[0.00-3.17]Haha, he’ll drop dead.
LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_3_CHARLINE_17909=[0.06-1.41]Now’s the time![2.50-6.35]We’ll find a nice place, split the expenses.
LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_3_CHARLINE_17912=[0.04-4.94]Good riddance to this fricking suit that smells like an old gym bag.[5.42-9.31]Goodbye to grinding coffee beans until your palms blister!

LW_WA_STATE_4_GROUP_3_CHARLINE_17915=[1.46-5.25]Imagine dad’s face when we tell him we’re leaving.
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17917=[0.05-2.73]Some real strange news I hear.
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17919=[0.03-2.87]Hmm, I suppose you’re right.[3.72-8.31]As long as they don’t come and disturb our sauna-nights, we’ll be fine.
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17920=[0.00-3.22]So you don’t think there’s anything to worry about,[3.36-6.15]with all that’s going on around here these days?
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17922=[0.15-0.76]Huh.[2.32-5.34]I wouldn’t have taken you for a philosopher.
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_1_17923=[0.03-1.76]So, more 'löyly?
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_2_17918=[0.04-2.41]Best to keep your head down and mind your own business.
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_2_17921=[1.92-3.92]I think worrying is a fool’s game.
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_1_OLD_SAUNA-GOER_2_17924=[0.07-0.86]More 'löyly'.
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_2_SUOMI_HALL_TOWNIE_17926=[0.00-0.60]Hear what?
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_2_SUOMI_HALL_TOWNIE_17928=[0.03-3.66]Big city folk, the FBI, famous writers...[4.27-5.93]They’re all bad luck if you ask me.
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_2_SUOMI_HALL_TOWNIE_17929=[0.03-2.72]So is everyone alright down there in Bright Falls?
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_2_SUOMI_HALL_TOWNIE_17931=[0.07-4.45]And it used to be such a nice, quiet place too, like Watery.[4.87-6.91]Before certain people came to town...
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_2_TOWN_GOSSIP_17925=[0.04-1.77]And now the Sheriff’s Station![2.35-3.15]Did you hear?
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_2_TOWN_GOSSIP_17927=[0.06-4.66]Apparently they locked up that crime writer, you know, the one who disappeared in Bright Falls years ago?[5.05-8.55]And then, they find him, and boom - all hell breaks loose.
LW_WA_STATE_5_GROUP_2_TOWN_GOSSIP_17930=[0.03-1.04]I just don’t know.[1.92-3.65]There’s a lot of good folk in that town.[4.36-5.59]A lot of friendly folk.

We and you both agree to make reasonable and good faith efforts to resolve any dispute between us informally.<cf><cf>If you reside in the EU, you may also be entitled to submit your complaint to the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution (“ODR”) Platform. ODR allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to the online purchases of goods and services without going to court.<cf><cf>4.2.  FOR USERS RESIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES OR REST OF WORLD (NOT THE UNITED KINGDOM OR EUROPEAN UNION): This Agreement is entered into in the State of North Carolina and shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of North Carolina without regard to any state’s choice or conflict of law rules. For any claims not subject to binding individual arbitration, you and the Company agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Wake County, North Carolina, and you and the Company hereby consent to venue in and personal jurisdiction before such courts (but without prejudicing either party’s rights to remove a case to federal court if permissible). This Section will be interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits. We have the right to prosecute civil claims against you for any violation of this Agreement, or any other governing terms and conditions related to the Software, whether for breach of contract, violation of common law rights, or violation of any applicable state or federal statute.<cf>  <cf>5. Dispute Resolution; Binding Individual Arbitration; Class Action Waiver (outside the UK and EU). <cf><cf>SUMMARY: for users not in the UK and EU, informal dispute resolution is a required first step in attempting to resolve any dispute (as defined in Section 5.1 below) between you and Epic.      After this, any arbitration will be on an individual basis only.<cf><cf><cf>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND DISCOVERY PROCEDURES AND APPELLATE RIGHTS ARE MORE LIMITED THAN IN COURT. <cf>Most issues can be resolved quickly and amicably by contacting Epic player support at https://www.epicgames.com/customer-service. But we understand that sometimes disputes can’t be easily resolved by player support. This Section explains how you and Epic will resolve those disputes, claims or controversies including (where applicable) by binding, individual arbitration. <cf>This Section 5 will be interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits.<cf><cf>5.1.  Disputes that Must Be Arbitrated.  The informal resolution and binding individual arbitration requirements in Section 5 apply to all Disputes between you and Epic. “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy (excluding those exceptions listed below) between you and Epic, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, that either party seeks legal recourse for and that relates to your use or attempted use of the Software, or that relates to this Agreement, including but not limited to the validity, enforceability, or scope of this agreement to arbitrate or any portion of it. <cf>The exceptions to this arbitration requirement are: (i) claims that can be brought as individual actions in small-claims court; (ii) pursuit of enforcement actions through a government agency if the law allows; (iii) a complaint or remedy under the EU General Data Protection Regulation; (iv) an action to compel or uphold any prior arbitration decision; (v) your or Epic’s right to seek injunctive relief in a court of law to preserve the status quo while an arbitration proceeds; (vi) claims of intellectual-property; and (vii) the enforceability of the requirement that arbitrations must be conducted on an individual rather than a class basis. If you are a party to other agreements with Epic besides this one, and another agreement does not require arbitration of disputes, an arbitrator will decide which disputes between you and Epic are subject to arbitration and which (if any) may be heard in court.<cf>This Section 5 only applies to Disputes and does not prevent either party from taking unilateral actions they are entitled to take under this Agreement. This means, for example, that you can terminate your Epic Account at any time without following this dispute resolution process. Likewise, Epic may enforce this Agreement through actions like suspending and terminating your account or access to a product at any time, in its sole discretion, without following this dispute resolution process. This freedom to unilaterally act in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is important so that you do not have to keep using products that you don’t want to and so that Epic can ensure a positive and fair experience for users of our products by doing things like taking immediate action against players engaged in cheating, pirating, or violating others’ rights in their intellectual property.  If you or Epic believe that the other has made a mistake about what actions this Agreement allow them to take (e.g., you disagree with Epic suspending or terminating your access to a game or your account for cheating, pirating, or infringing intellectual property), that disagreement is a Dispute that must be resolved using the process set forth in this Section 5.<cf><cf>5.2 Informal Resolution. If you have a Dispute against Epic or if Epic has a Dispute against you, you and Epic will attempt to resolve the Dispute informally before an arbitration is filed in order to resolve the Dispute faster and reduce costs for both parties. You and Epic will make a good-faith effort to negotiate the resolution of any Dispute for at least 30 days (“Informal Resolution”) from the day you receive or Epic receives a written notice of a dispute from the other party (a “Notice of Dispute”) in accordance with this Agreement’s terms.<cf>You will send any Notice of Dispute to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: NOTICE OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A. Epic will send any Notice of Dispute to your registered email address and ATTN: NOTICE OF DISPUTE to any billing address you have provided us. The Notice of Dispute sent by either party must include the sender’s name, address, and other contact information, a description of the Dispute (including any relevant account names), and what resolution to the Dispute is being sought. <cf>The Informal Resolution requirement is designed to allow Epic (or you, in the case of a Dispute Epic asserts against you) to make a fair, fact-based offer of settlement if it chooses to do so. You or Epic cannot proceed to arbitration before the end of the Informal Resolution period. If you or Epic proceed to arbitration without providing a compliant Notice of Dispute and waiting until the conclusion of the Informal Resolution period, a court may enjoin the filing and order the party that has not followed the Informal Resolution process to reimburse the other party for any arbitration fees and costs already incurred. The compliance of a Notice of Dispute with the terms of this Agreement, including whether a Notice of Dispute contained all required information, is an issue to be decided by a court. If you reside in the European Union (“EU”), You may also be entitled to submit Your complaint to the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform. ODR allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to the online purchases of goods and services without going to court.<cf><cf>5.3 Small Claims Court. You and Epic agree that disputes that qualify for small-claims court in either the county where you live or Wake County, North Carolina may be brought as individual actions only in such small-claims courts. <cf><cf>5.4 Binding Individual Arbitration. THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS IN THIS SECTION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY. Under no circumstances does Epic consent to have any Disputes arbitrated using class action procedures, even if the arbitration provider has rules permitting class arbitrations.<cf>You and Epic agree that Disputes will be settled by binding individual arbitration conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), https://namadr.com, according to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and federal arbitration law and according to NAM’s Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the Dispute arises (the “Rules”), as modified by this Agreement, unless you reside in a country where NAM is not available to arbitrate the Dispute, in which case the arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), https://www.adr.org.<cf>For Disputes that must be arbitrated by AAA, you are a “Consumer,” and the then-current version of the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules are the Rules applicable to Disputes between you and Epic as modified by this Agreement. This Agreement affects interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this Section 12(d) will be substantively and procedurally governed by the FAA, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., to the extent permitted by law. <cf>“Arbitration” means that Disputes you have with Epic and Disputes Epic has with you will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury. <cf>“Individual” means that the arbitrator may award the same remedies to you or Epic as a court could, but only to satisfy your or Epic’s individual claims. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the arbitrator may not award money or other relief for the benefit of any person other than you or Epic as part of the resolution of any Dispute.<cf>“Binding” means that both you and Epic will have to live with the arbitrator’s decision, except to the limited extent appeals to a court are permitted under the FAA. As limited by the FAA, this Agreement, and the Rules applicable to the arbitration, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Agreement, but (as provided above) only to the extent necessary to provide relief to a party in arbitration warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.<cf><cf>Arbitration Procedure and Location<cf>You or Epic may initiate arbitration of any Disputes not resolved by Informal Resolution by filing a Demand for Arbitration with NAM in accordance with the Rules (or with AAA in accordance with the Rules if you reside in a country where NAM is not available to arbitrate the Dispute).<cf>(Instructions for filing a Demand for Arbitration with NAM are available on the NAM website or by calling NAM at 800-358-2550, and instructions for filing a Demand for Arbitration with AAA are available on the AAA website or by calling AAA at 800-778-7879.) You will send a copy of any Demand for Arbitration to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A. Epic will send any Demand for Arbitration to the email address and to any billing address you have provided us.<cf>The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. You and Epic both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language and that the arbitrator will be bound by this Agreement.<cf>For Disputes in which the claimant seeks less than USD $10,000, the arbitrator will decide the matter solely on the basis of written submissions, without a formal hearing, unless the arbitrator decides that a formal hearing is necessary. For matters in which the claimant seeks USD $10,000 or more, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator determines a hearing to be necessary, hearings shall be conducted by video or telephone, unless the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing to be necessary. If an in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States, the hearing will take place in Wake County, North Carolina, unless the arbitrator determines that this would pose a hardship for the claimant, in which case the in-person hearing may be conducted in the claimant’s state and county of residence. If you reside outside the United States, the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by the applicable Rules. <cf>The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and Epic agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions. <cf>To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are individual to you or Epic to satisfy one of our individual claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence). <cf>An arbitration award, and any judgment confirming it, apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used or offered as precedent in any other case except to enforce the award itself.<cf>Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial confirmation of any award and an order of enforcement.<cf><cf>Consumer Arbitration Fees<cf>If you start an arbitration against Epic, you will pay the filing fee required for consumer arbitrations. In some situations, Epic will help you with the fees related to an arbitration you start against Epic to (hopefully) get us to a resolution quickly and fairly:<cf>● If the Dispute involves a claim of damages of USD $10,000 or less, including any attorneys’ fees and all other relief you are seeking, Epic will pay all of the arbitration costs, including the fees you otherwise would have been required to pay. <cf>● Even if the Dispute involves a claim of damages of more than USD $10,000, Epic may still help you with your fees: if you demonstrate that arbitration costs will be prohibitive compared to litigation costs, Epic will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator finds is necessary to prevent arbitration from being cost-prohibitive (as compared to the cost of litigation).<cf>● For purposes of calculating damages under this paragraph, similar claims brought by multiple claimants represented by the same or coordinated counsel will be aggregated.<cf>If Epic starts an arbitration against you, Epic will pay all filing fees and costs, including the fees you otherwise would have been required to pay.<cf>Arbitration costs do not include your attorneys’ fees and expenses if you choose to be represented by an attorney. If you choose to be represented by an attorney, you will pay your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless the applicable law provides otherwise. <cf>Even if Epic wins the arbitration and the applicable law or Rules allow Epic to seek our portion of the arbitration costs from you, we won’t do so for any arbitration claims that were brought in good faith and in compliance with this Agreement. What this means is that Epic will only seek arbitration costs or attorneys’ fees from you (as governed by the arbitrator’s Rules and allowed by applicable law) if you brought any claims frivolously, for an improper purpose (like to harass Epic), without sufficiently investigating the facts or applicable law before bringing your claim, or without complying with this Agreement. <cf><cf>Notice and Filing<cf>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you or Epic must start arbitration of a Dispute within two (2) years from when the Dispute first arose. If applicable law requires you or Epic to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than two years after the Dispute first arose, that shorter deadline applies instead. The failure to begin arbitration regarding a Dispute within the time frames described above in this section shall bar the Dispute, which means that you and Epic will not have the right to assert the Dispute.<cf><cf>Coordinated Filings<cf>If 25 or more Notices of Disputes are sent that raise similar claims and have the same or coordinated counsel, these will be considered “Coordinated Cases” and will be treated as mass filings or multiple case filings according to the Rules, if and to the extent Coordinated Cases are filed in arbitration as set forth in this Agreement. Epic or you may advise the other of its or your belief that cases are Coordinated Cases, and disputes over whether a case or cases meet the contractual definition of “Coordinated Cases” will be decided by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter. Demands for Arbitration in Coordinated Cases shall only be filed with the arbitration provider as permitted by the bellwether process set forth below. Epic will pay only its share of arbitration fees for Coordinated Cases; the claimants will be responsible for their share of those fees.  Applicable statutes of limitations will be tolled for claims asserted in a Coordinated Case from the time a compliant Notice of Dispute has been received by a party until, under the terms of this Agreement, the Coordinated Case may be filed in arbitration or court.<cf>Once counsel in the Coordinated Cases has advised Epic that all or substantially all of the Notices of Dispute have been provided, counsel for the parties shall confer in good faith regarding the number of cases that should proceed in arbitration as bellwethers, to allow each side to test the merits of its arguments. If counsel for the parties do not agree on the number of bellwethers, an even number shall be chosen by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter (or, in the arbitration provider’s discretion, by a process arbitrator). Factors that the arbitration provider may consider in making this decision include the complexity of the dispute and differences in facts or applicable laws among various cases. Once the number of bellwethers is fixed, by agreement or by the arbitration provider, each side shall select half that number from among the claimants who have provided compliant Notices of Dispute, and only those chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider. The parties acknowledge that resolution of some Coordinated Cases will be delayed by this bellwether process.<cf>A single arbitrator shall preside over each Coordinated Case chosen for a bellwether proceeding, and only one Coordinated Case may be assigned to each arbitrator as part of a bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise.  <cf>Once all bellwether trials have concluded (or sooner if the counsel for the claimants and Epic agree), the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining Coordinated Cases, with each side paying half the applicable mediation fee. Epic and counsel for the claimants must agree on a mediator within 30 days after the conclusion of the last bellwether trial. If counsel for Epic and claimants cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. Epic and counsel for the claimants will cooperate for the purpose of ensuring that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as practicable after the mediator is appointed.<cf>If the mediation does not yield a global resolution, this arbitration requirement shall no longer apply to Disputes that are the subject of Coordinated Cases for which a compliant Notice of Dispute was received by the other party but that were not resolved in bellwether proceedings. Such Disputes may be filed only in the state courts in Wake County, North Carolina, or if federal jurisdiction exists, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, and you consent as part of this Agreement to venue such cases exclusively in these courts. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as prohibiting either you or Epic from removing a case from state to federal court if removal is allowed under applicable law. To the extent you are asserting the same claims as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated counsel, you agree to waive any objection that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable. If a formerly arbitrable Dispute is brought in court, claimants may seek class treatment, but to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the classes sought may comprise only the claimants in the Coordinated Cases who provided compliant Notices of Dispute, and any party may contest class certification at any stage of the litigation and on any available basis.  <cf>A court shall have authority to enforce this bellwether process and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.<cf><cf>Continuation in Effect<cf>The dispute resolution process set forth in this Section 5 survives any termination of this Agreement or Epic’s provision of Software to you.<cf><cf>Future Agreement Changes<cf>Although Epic may revise this Agreement in its discretion, Epic does not have the right to alter this Agreement to arbitrate or the rules specified herein with respect to any Dispute once that Dispute arises, if such change would make arbitration procedures less favorable to the claimant.<cf><cf>5.5 Class Action Waiver. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, for any case not subject to the requirement to arbitrate (except to the limited extent discussed above for Coordinated Cases), you and Epic will only bring disputes, claims, or controversies between you and Epic that relate to your use or attempted use of the Software generally, or that relate to this Agreement, in an individual capacity and shall not:<cf>● seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (like private attorney general actions); or<cf>● consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit another to do so without the express consent of all parties to this Agreement.<cf><cf>5.6 Severability. If all or any provision of this Section 5 is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then you and Epic agree that the provision will be severed, and the rest of this Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included. The sole exception is that if the prohibition on class arbitrations is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, you and Epic agree that this entire Section 5 will be void and unenforceable and any dispute will be resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of law clauses specified in this Agreement. <cf><cf>5.7 Your 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of and not to be bound by the Binding Individual Arbitration provisions set forth in this Agreement. To exercise this right, you must send written notice of your decision to the following address: Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: ARBITRATION OPT-OUT, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A. Your notice must include your name, mailing address, and Epic Account, and state that you do not wish to be bound by the Binding Individual Arbitration provisions set forth in this Agreement. TO BE EFFECTIVE, THIS NOTICE MUST BE POSTMARKED OR DEPOSITED WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ACCEPTED THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW; OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE BOUND TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION. You are responsible for ensuring that Epic receives your opt-out notice, so you may wish to send it by a means that provides for a delivery receipt. If you opt out of these provisions, Epic will not be bound by them with respect to disputes with you.<cf><cf>6.

MM_IN02_010_WAKE_3935=[0.03-1.85]I had to find the subway station.
MM_IN02_010_WAKE_3939=[0.00-4.12]The Caldera Street Station sign was there, but the entrance was missing.[5.01-6.17]I had to make it appear.
MM_IN02_010_WAKE_3941=[0.00-2.61]Maybe I could use the lamp to reveal the station entrance.
MM_IN02_010_WAKE_3942=[0.06-1.57]The lamp was dead in my hand.[2.04-3.61]I needed to find a light for it.
MM_IN02_010_WAKE_3945=[0.03-2.67]I needed a light to open the entrance to the station.

MM_IN02_025_TAMMY_DP_3997=[0.00-3.86]They say the cult reenacted the murders in Alan Wake’s crime books.[4.11-8.83]That Wake was even involved somehow, under a false identity: Mr. Scratch.[9.11-12.34]Which is, of course, a nickname for the devil himself.
MM_IN02_025_WAKE_12838=[0.28-0.90]Shit.[1.91-3.17]I don’t like the sound of that.
MM_IN02_025_WAKE_12839=[0.05-1.22]The water was gone.[2.21-3.99]The way forward was open.

MM_IN02_025_WAKE_4000=[0.03-6.93]It was disturbing finding myself in the story this way, but I was desperate and it felt right for the story.
MM_IN02_025_WAKE_4001=[0.03-2.31]I was making my way deeper into the story.
MM_IN02_025_WAKE_4002=[0.05-4.47]I could imagine this murder cult performing their macabre acts beyond the collapsed tunnel.
MM_IN02_025_WAKE_4003=[0.05-3.46]The cultist laid the Casey novel onto the altar with reverence.[4.24-5.44]Their twisted bible.
MM_IN02_025_WAKE_7626=[0.03-2.00]The Dark Place had reacted to my story.[2.56-4.65]The way into the tunnels was no longer blocked.
MM_IN02_025_WAKE_7627=[0.03-2.28]The fed had glimpsed into the maw of darkness.[3.03-4.28]It swallowed him whole.
MM_IN02_025_WAKE_7628=[0.03-1.33]The tunnels were a maze.[2.08-3.64]The blood trail led me on.
MM_IN02_025_WAKE_7629=[0.08-2.60]I needed to search the tunnels for further visions.[3.10-5.66]Inspiration for the story that would lead me deeper.
MM_IN02_030_CASEY_DP_4006=[0.00-4.11]Turns out the cultists weren’t the only ones using the tunnels. [4.46-7.76]Hidden markings led to secret routes.
MM_IN02_030_CASEY_DP_4007=[0.00-8.26]I kept hearing whispers around burn barrels of an underground society of mystic outsiders with hidden knowledge.[8.60-10.98]Typical New York.
MM_IN02_030_CASEY_DP_4013=[0.00-0.92]Go on, ma’am.
MM_IN02_030_CASEY_DP_4015=[0.02-0.93]Charming.
MM_IN02_030_CASEY_DP_7637=[0.04-2.88]There are no happy endings in this city.
MM_IN02_030_TAMMY_DP_4014=[0.00-2.88]This is where the history of the cult gets genuinely disturbing.[3.47-6.42]The cultists tracked down the Torchbearers living in the tunnels.[6.78-13.41]They locked the poor folks up in a derailed subway car, doused it in gasoline, and… yeah.
MM_IN02_030_TAMMY_DP_4016=[0.03-2.40]It turns into a bit of a ghost story after that.[2.90-7.83]They say the dark smoke from the fire still roams the tunnels, searching for new victims to devour.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_12840=[0.06-0.99]The murder site.[1.85-2.95]It’s here somewhere.[3.69-5.81]I needed to find it to travel deeper.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_14048=[0.00-1.90]This is where the drifters had lived.[2.71-3.71]Where were they now?
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_14049=[0.00-2.19]The story thread felt important. [2.90-5.14]I could use it in one of the scenes I’d found.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_18196=[0.03-2.18]I had found another story thread I could use.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_23423=[0.07-1.35]My path was blocked.[1.91-3.43]I had to find a way through.[4.23-5.47]The lights would help me.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_24303=[0.00-0.97]Fuck me.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_4004=[0.03-3.24]The train blocked my way forward, but it was here for a reason.[3.64-4.68]It had a role to play.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_4008=[0.11-2.23]This was pointing me in the right direction.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_4009=[0.00-3.08]My flashlight revealed painted messages on the walls.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_4019=[0.03-4.10]A sick and twisted story, but it worked.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_4021=[0.07-0.62]Ugh.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_4022=[0.00-1.24]None of this was real.[2.49-3.55]It was all real.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_4023=[0.03-2.34]I had found a way deeper into the tunnels.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_7636=[0.00-2.40]The drifters had scrawled their symbol on the wall.[3.05-3.74]A secret.[4.19-5.37]For those in the know.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_7638=[0.00-2.22]The subway car had become a burnt husk.[3.04-4.24]I could get through it now.
MM_IN02_030_WAKE_7639=[0.06-2.35]The cultists turned their backs on the fire.[3.23-5.69]Now there would be no one to disturb their ceremony.
MM_IN02_035_CASEY_DP_4027=[0.00-3.49]The fed had witnessed something here that made him run scared.[4.02-7.80]Whether the summoning ritual had been a bona fide supernatural event-[7.80-11.47]or the mass psychosis of stark raving lunatics,[11.72-13.37]it didn’t change the facts.[13.86-18.33]The cult was messing with things no one should mess with.
MM_IN02_035_CULTISTS_4026=[0.00-4.48]This is the ritual to lead you on.
MM_IN02_035_WAKE_12841=[2.48-12.08]It doesn’t work!
MM_IN02_035_WAKE_12842=[0.03-1.58]I couldn’t hear the Dark Presence.[2.80-3.68]It was gone.
MM_IN02_035_WAKE_14050=[0.00-2.42]The ritual was a vital part of the story. [2.59-4.36]The key to reaching the murder site.
MM_IN02_035_WAKE_14051=[0.00-1.35]I was back at the camp.
MM_IN02_035_WAKE_4024=[0.03-2.00]The echoing hall had a story to tell.
MM_IN02_035_WAKE_4025=[0.03-1.56]The cultists were close now.[1.77-3.99]A dark presence rising from the depths.
MM_IN02_035_WAKE_4029=[0.03-3.33]The end of a horror story is the most dangerous part.
MM_IN02_035_WAKE_4031=[0.00-1.28]The Dark Presence, fuck. [1.49-1.92]Fuck. [2.10-2.56]Fuck. [2.82-3.50]Fuck. [3.56-4.38]Fuck. [4.46-5.45]Fuck! [5.51-6.46]Fuck!  
MM_IN02_035_WAKE_7746=[0.03-2.60]The hall had changed into the murder cult’s hideout.
MM_IN02_035_WAKE_7874=[0.05-1.21]The tunnel was open now.[1.57-2.50]I could get through.
MM_IN02_040_WAKE_4032=[0.11-1.33]Something was different.[3.19-4.41]The murder site was close.
MM_IN02_040_WAKE_4033=[0.05-1.41]I had found the murder site.[2.18-4.15]Somehow the victim’s heart was the key.
MM_IN02_040_WAKE_7960=[0.00-0.90]The Dark Presence.[0.90-3.77]I had seen it before.[4.95-5.87]I remembered now.[5.87-9.98]It was always out there, hunting me.
MM_IN02_045_CASEY_DP_4046=[0.03-4.27]Stepping to the murder site, I had felt it, hanging in the air.[4.74-5.77]A meaning.[6.20-8.49]The violent emotion of the act.[9.03-10.95]Like a cloud of wrath.
MM_IN02_045_CASEY_DP_4047=[0.00-4.63]The dead eyes of the victim, staring at something you couldn’t see, [4.79-7.94]and yet, making you aware of it.
MM_IN02_045_CASEY_DP_4048=[0.00-4.05]Something had soaked into this place on a molecular level.[4.10-8.25]Overlapping with your meaningless existence.[8.49-13.21]A regression to something you had managed to forget.[13.40-15.17]Marking you.[15.31-17.84]Taking you for a ride.[18.08-20.22]Making you crazier.
MM_IN02_045_WAKE_4045=[0.17-2.99]I had found a way deeper into the Dark Place.[3.66-6.48]When I did, the poem had grown.[7.79-9.20]I didn’t write any of it.[9.99-12.32]It cast a shadow over what I had gained.[13.34-14.58]Made my skin crawl.
MM_IN02_ADDITIONAL_01_CULTISTS_5442=[0.00-4.28]This is the ritual to lead you on.

MM_IN02_ADDITIONAL_02_DP_MULLIGAN_5445=[0.28-2.20]Some fed came looking for the cult.[2.24-4.10]But it was a trap.[4.13-6.31]A satanic blood sacrifice.
MM_IN02_ADDITIONAL_02_DP_MULLIGAN_5447=[0.03-1.95]Sounds like a load of bull.
MM_IN02_ADDITIONAL_02_DP_THORNTON_5444=[0.03-2.25]It’s bad luck to be on this case.[2.78-6.23]The cult can get you anywhere, with that black magic shit.[6.84-8.54]Let the day shift handle it.[9.35-10.72]What happened anyway?
MM_IN02_ADDITIONAL_02_DP_THORNTON_5446=[0.00-3.81]Anyone who gets involved with the cult, they’re next.[4.39-8.28]I heard their leader is this famous writer, Alan Wake.[8.81-11.72]Their unholy motherfucking messiah.
MM_IN02_ADDITIONAL_02_WAKE_7433=[0.00-1.95]The blood trail disappeared under the rubble.[3.10-5.09]I had a feeling something was waiting there.
MM_IN02_ADDITIONAL_02_WAKE_7434=[0.00-2.81]The federal agent had come here looking for answers.[3.97-6.11]All he had found was a fate worse than death.
MM_IN02_ADDITIONAL_03_CASEY_DP_5448=[0.08-2.42]The Torchbearers painted the tree there.[3.21-5.19]The tree of knowledge?[6.03-10.02]The tree of life, with its roots reaching down to hell?[11.04-14.08]It could have been a Christmas tree, for all the good it did them.

MM_IN02_ADDITIONAL_04_WAKE_7436=[0.00-0.43]Dead...
MM_IN02_ADDITIONAL_05_WAKE_12843=[0.03-2.62]The cult poured the gasoline over the train car.[3.43-6.64]An iron cage that would soon become a coffin.
MM_IN02_ADDITIONAL_05_WAKE_5450=[0.03-3.55]The door on the far side of the train crash had a Cult symbol next to it.[4.48-6.08]I wanted to take a look inside.

MM_IN05_025A_CASEY_13127=[0.03-5.94]I could sense the Cult of the Word in this, and their leader, Mr. Scratch.[6.57-10.65]Rumored to be Alan Wake, the writer who’d gone missing years before.

MM_IN05_025A_CASEY_13156=[0.00-3.28]Mr.Scratch as the devil.[4.02-6.16]He was born to play the role.

MM_IN05_025A_CULTISTS_13142=[0.04-4.09]This is the ritual to lead you on.
MM_IN05_025A_CULTISTS_13147=[0.13-4.86]This is the ritual to lead you on.

MM_IN05_025A_ED_13145=[0.00-4.88]Supposedly an actual cult once performed an unspeakable ritual to summon...[5.90-7.52]something in the ballroom.[8.19-12.00]Did we summon the same thing, tapped into something horrifying?[13.26-17.46]It seemed like it was part of the play, but it wasn’t.[18.89-20.07]Does that sound crazy?
MM_IN05_025A_ED_13152=[0.03-1.80]This is what we called the Writer’s Room.[2.68-7.14]In the play it’s where the Devil rewrites reality while god is asleep.
MM_IN05_025A_ED_13153=[0.04-1.71]The Devil was our star role.[2.34-4.77]I got a big-time celebrity to play him.[5.06-7.93]And he was method acting the role to perfection.[8.18-10.87]He never broke character, always wore the cult mask.[11.16-13.19]His name was scratched out on the posters.
MM_IN05_025A_ED_13155=[0.03-4.41]I wish I could tell you, but turns out there were masks upon masks.[4.95-8.76]Whoever he really was, shit got weird when he was around.[9.62-13.43]Some of the crew joked that we’d actually hired the devil to play himself.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13123=[0.00-3.53]Thomas Zane had ended our talk in what felt like a paranoid fit.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13124=[0.00-1.23]I had what I needed from him.[1.69-5.61]There was another murder site in the hotel, to guide me further toward my escape.[6.05-7.69]I had to write my way to it.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13125=[0.04-1.43]An idea nagged at me.[2.32-3.47]I could almost reach it.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13128=[0.00-2.83]The hotel was a perfect setting for a Casey story.[3.87-5.05]I was on the right path.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13129=[0.03-1.99]I would start at the entrance lobby.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13130=[0.07-1.57]The entrance hall set the mood.[1.74-6.19]Where everyone had come in: the victim, the murderer, the detective.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13131=[0.03-2.47]I was both solving the crime and creating it.[3.06-4.21]As every writer did.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13132=[0.00-3.87]An idea, clear as a vision, waited for me here.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13137=[0.11-1.30]“The pre-show ritual”.[1.78-2.32]That’s it.[3.00-3.72]Set it up.[4.18-5.28]Start from the beginning.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13138=[0.03-2.48]The room at the end of the corridor was closed off.[3.33-4.37]It felt significant.[5.37-7.01]Something terrible would happen there.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13139=[0.07-2.97]The ballroom would be the stage of a key scene in the play.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13140=[0.00-1.79]This is where they gathered before the play.[2.98-3.95]This is where it began.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13141=[0.03-2.53]Another vision, another idea.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13148=[0.00-1.16]It’s getting real, all right.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13149=[0.03-2.37]I recognized my Writer’s Room on the stage.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13150=[0.07-2.74]I almost dreaded the ideas this would conjure up.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13157=[0.10-1.57]I had no memory of that.[2.25-3.95]It must have been a dark time for me.[4.85-7.56]The visions were crucial to keep the story moving.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13158=[0.03-2.98]The devil’s path up the staircase was draped in blood.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_13159=[0.00-2.08]I felt the presence of a new idea here.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_18197=[0.00-2.58]The ballroom was where the pre-show ritual was held.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_18198=[0.03-1.20]A haunted hotel.[1.50-1.93]Yes.[2.75-3.93]It’s a trope for a reason.
MM_IN05_025A_WAKE_18199=[0.03-1.90]I had to agree with Casey on that.
MM_IN05_025B_CASEY_13163=[0.00-0.48]Okay.[0.63-6.56]Let’s talk about the murder victim, the lady who was killed in the climax of the play.
MM_IN05_025B_CASEY_13165=[0.03-1.58]She was staying in room 108?[1.96-2.96]Where the murder happened?
MM_IN05_025B_CASEY_13167=[0.00-1.17]To murder her.
MM_IN05_025B_ED_13164=[0.04-1.02]The leading lady.[1.02-4.35]It was an honor to get to work with her.[5.54-7.67]A “grand dame”, for sure.[8.89-10.53]She went back a long time.[11.36-15.57]Kept insisting she had seen the long-lost, original script of the play.[16.49-19.87]She’d been with its mysterious writer, his muse.[21.23-24.24]That was her role in the play, the Muse.
MM_IN05_025B_ED_13166=[0.00-1.79]The set of the final scene, right.[2.50-7.12]The Devil comes, an unstoppable force, crashing through the hotel, through each scene,[7.32-12.96]executed with devastating mastery, all leading up to him meeting his Muse.[14.87-16.09]Turns out he knew her.[18.36-21.41]He had only joined the play to get to her.
MM_IN05_025B_WAKE_13161=[0.03-1.26]Scratch had been here.[2.30-4.69]I could sense his presence lingering in the room.
MM_IN05_025B_WAKE_13162=[0.05-2.16]I was about to have another killer idea.
MM_IN05_025B_WAKE_13168=[0.04-1.41]The Muse was the murder victim.[2.07-4.56]The final scene took place in room 108.
MM_IN05_025B_WAKE_13169=[0.00-0.98]Not you again!
MM_IN05_025B_WAKE_13170=[0.03-5.45]The Dark Presence had come for me, drawn to the story I was writing as it grew darker.
MM_IN05_025B_WAKE_13171=[0.13-0.72]Shit!
MM_IN05_025B_WAKE_13172=[0.03-0.60]Get away![1.33-1.86]Get away!
MM_IN05_025B_WAKE_13173=[0.00-1.55]Get the fuck away from me!
MM_IN05_025B_WAKE_13174=[0.03-1.65]I had to reach the light ahead.[1.65-3.19]To hide from the Dark Presence.
MM_IN05_025B_WAKE_13175=[0.03-1.13]Made it.[1.37-2.76]I made it.[2.99-3.42]Ha!
MM_IN05_025B_WAKE_13176=[0.03-1.35]I needed to find the Muse.[1.73-2.56]The murder victim.[2.88-4.02]Room 108.
MM_IN05_030_WAKE_13177=[0.03-1.29]This was the murder site.[1.95-5.57]There was a record at the bottom of the bathtub, beneath the body.[6.24-7.75]Somehow it was important.
MM_IN05_035_CASEY_13188=[0.00-6.57]Had I chosen to pursue the cult, or had they chosen me for some unknowable purpose,[7.32-14.89]to be a demon to sort the clues based on my interpretation, to change that which I observed?
MM_IN05_035_CASEY_13189=[0.03-6.08]It was all a play, shadows on the wall of a cave, an echo of the true events-[6.08-7.90]that happened somewhere else.[8.63-12.85]Was I there to watch the shadows, or was I a shadow too,[13.57-17.19]in a performance set up for someone else?
MM_IN05_035_WAKE_13187=[0.00-2.47]I was traveling deeper into the Dark Place.[3.41-11.10]The poem on the wall was growing at the same pace, dogging my footsteps like my unwanted shadow moving in the corner of my eye.[12.16-13.22]It wasn’t my writing.[14.27-15.33]I didn’t know what it was.[16.09-20.08]A terrible prophecy, a curse, looming over me.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_01_WAKE_13074=[0.03-1.15]Layers upon layers.[2.13-5.75]A play about a murder cult infiltrated by a real murder cult.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_02_WAKE_13075=[0.03-4.16]The prop room had been changed from room 104 to room 225.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_02_WAKE_13076=[0.14-2.57]The troupe were busy building their own wicker man,[3.09-5.20]where they themselves would be sacrificed.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_03_WAKE_13077=[0.08-4.07]The rehearsal room had been moved from room 219 to room 202.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_03_WAKE_13078=[0.03-2.98]The cult in the play was called the Cult of the Tree.[3.59-8.52]With their deer masks, they were the backwoods echo of the Cult of the Word’s urban horror.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_04_CULTISTS_13079=[0.00-4.39]This is the ritual to lead you on.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_05_CULTISTS_13080=[0.00-3.70]This is the ritual to lead you on.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_06_CULTISTS_13081=[0.00-4.06]This is the ritual to lead you on.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_07_WAKE_13082=[0.05-4.66]The devil walked through the hotel, dragging the whole place to hell with him.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_08_WAKE_13083=[0.04-1.19]This is not my writing.[1.54-3.17]It’s Scratch, mocking me.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_09_WAKE_13084=[0.00-2.76]This was not the ritual murder site I was looking for.[3.68-6.33]This had just been an appetizer before the main course.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_10_DP_MULLIGAN_13086=[0.00-4.08]This is our chance to make the powers-that-be happy.[4.66-8.42]We’ll be set for life, part of the inner circle.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_10_DP_MULLIGAN_13089=[0.00-1.37]Open and shut case.[1.74-5.73]All we got to do now is to dump the evidence from room 108-[5.82-8.15]in the usual place in the alley.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_10_DP_THORNTON_13085=[0.00-5.63]I’ve had enough of that freaking gumshoe dick asking too many freaking questions,[5.93-8.84]not letting us proper police take care of it.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_10_DP_THORNTON_13087=[0.08-1.71]Amen to that, partner.[2.39-3.14]I like it.[3.68-10.16]And so will the fraternity, the club, the Word, our dear friends with many names.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_10_DP_THORNTON_13088=[0.00-3.83]The way I see it, it was a lone nutjob,[3.88-8.58]a junkie out of his mind on some fancy new designer drug.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_11_WAKE_13090=[0.00-3.20]The dirty cops would make sure none of this would be traced back-[3.25-5.97]to their diabolical masters hiding in the dark.
MM_IN05_ADDITIONAL_12_WAKE_13091=[0.05-3.11]Soon, what had happened here would be just another urban legend.[3.66-4.85]No one would know the truth.[5.40-6.22]Except for the Cult.[6.72-7.42]And Casey.
MM_IN06_005_WAKE_5394=[0.00-2.20]Parliament Tower was here, again.[2.94-5.99]Zane said the manuscript of “Return” was the key to escaping.[6.61-8.44]I had to get to it before Scratch did.
MM_IN06_005_WAKE_5395=[0.03-1.50]Scratch was closing in.[2.28-3.17]Gaining control.[3.82-5.97]I couldn’t let him escape the Dark Place.[6.09-7.78]I had to keep him from Alice.
MM_IN06_010_CASEY_DP_5398=[0.21-0.90]Delete line

MM_IN06_015_WAKE_14321=[0.03-0.66]Alice!
MM_IN06_015_WAKE_14322=[0.03-2.61]Alice had turned the bathroom into a dark room.
MM_IN06_015_WAKE_14323=[0.00-2.20]Alice’s work had consumed the apartment.[2.89-3.83]Her whole life.
MM_IN06_015_WAKE_5728=[0.09-2.23]I needed to get inside, to the manuscript.
MM_IN07_005_WAKE_5737=[0.03-2.61]The memory of my edits was already fading.[3.38-6.27]Terrible things would happen if the manuscript came true.[6.80-8.88]Scratch was there, at Parliament Tower.[8.95-10.16]Undoing my work.[10.72-12.18]He could use the story to escape.[12.82-14.11]He’d go after Alice.
MM_IN07_015_AHTI_DP_5739=[0.00-0.87]Hurry, Tom![1.98-4.33]Here is the light at the end of the tunnel.[5.54-8.31]If you come in last, you won’t be happy.
MM_IN07_015_AHTI_DP_5740=[0.00-3.49](Jumalauta), that held you close, Tom.[4.28-8.12](Ei muuta kun) onwards, said the granny in the snow.[8.37-11.81]When the panic is biggest, the help is also near.
MM_IN07_015_WAKE_14373=[0.00-1.37]Door, Zane.[1.80-3.65]The masks were finally coming off.[4.25-6.31]Was it a sign I was closer to escaping?[6.76-8.17]I had no time to waste.
MM_IN07_015_WAKE_5741=[0.00-1.10]Thank you for reminding me.
MM_IN07_020_ALICE_19853=[0.00-4.48]A spark, a bullet of light to push the darkness away.
MM_IN07_020_WAKE_14374=[0.00-1.03]Alice’s photos.[1.42-2.75]I recognized the style.[3.74-6.01]One showed the Clicker sinking into darkness.[6.75-8.84]The other showed a light in the shape of a bullet.[9.50-11.08]I needed to get them to the plaza.
MM_IN07_020_WAKE_5742=[0.00-1.42]These were Alice’s photos.[2.18-3.51]I recognized the style.[4.57-6.65]One showed the Clicker sinking into darkness.[7.50-9.50]The other showed a light in the shape of a bullet.[10.47-13.17]They were important, even if I didn’t know what to do with them yet.
MM_IN08_005_CASEY_DP_13479=[0.00-5.11]Aaah!
MM_IN08_005_CASEY_DP_13481=[0.00-5.62]Inside this messy, maze of blood trails I was chasing the cult through,[6.00-9.67]I ran into the film maker Thomas Zane.[10.07-18.04]An esoteric bohemian with a hard-on for acts of cruelty performed in the name of occult nonsense.[18.88-23.40]A director wants to control every aspect of the world in their films.[24.42-26.37]Is a cult leader any different?[27.16-31.00]Was Zane just another alias for Scratch?[31.86-36.53]There was a rumor that Wake and Zane had been working on something together.[37.26-42.34]I was going to get the truth out of Zane, with whatever means necessary.
MM_IN08_005_WAKE_13477=[0.00-2.89]To get to Parliament Tower, I needed to find a murder site.[3.50-4.85]Zane would know where to find one.
MM_IN08_005_WAKE_13478=[0.03-2.41]I would pay him a visit at the Oceanview Hotel.[3.00-4.81]I’d make that liar talk.
MM_IN08_005_WAKE_13480=[0.05-2.70]There was no longer any sign of Casey in the alley.[3.25-5.50]Things kept changing, gaining momentum.[5.70-8.49]Moving toward some obscured escalation.
MM_IN08_005_WAKE_13482=[0.20-1.81]Did I stop writing at some point?[2.31-3.31]I can’t stop.[3.67-5.08]There’s too much at stake.
MM_IN08_005_WAKE_13483=[0.11-2.53]Zane’s room, 665, was upstairs.[3.03-4.38]The elevator would take me there.
MM_IN08_005_WAKE_13484=[0.08-2.82]Something told me Zane wouldn’t be happy to see me this time.
MM_IN08_010_WAKE_13485=[0.05-2.36]I had to find the movie theater, Poet’s Cinema.[2.80-4.16]The next murder site was there.[4.76-9.24]Zane had created the film in tandem with “Return”, to escape the Dark Place.
MM_IN08_010_WAKE_15247=[0.00-1.25]What the fuck.
MM_IN08_010_WAKE_15248=[0.06-2.13]I had a million questions about Zane.[2.81-4.51]But I had more pressing concerns.
MM_IN08_010_WAKE_23432=[0.07-3.79]Zane had given me a ticket to the movie theater, Poet’s Cinema.[4.40-6.00]The next murder site was there.[6.52-11.23]Zane had created the film in tandem with “Return”, to escape the Dark Place.
MM_IN08_010_ZANE_15244=[0.28-0.90]Oh mercy.[1.01-2.17]Thousands have gone missing.[2.43-3.62]Beyond the labyrinth of me.[3.79-5.87]When you’re lost, you’re lost in your own company.
MM_IN08_010_ZANE_15245=[0.45-0.92]And...[1.29-1.81]cut!
MM_IN08_010_ZANE_15246=[0.44-1.50]Now that’s drama.
MM_IN08_015_TICKET_SELLER_13488=[0.00-1.88]Please enjoy the film, sir.
MM_IN08_015_WAKE_13486=[0.13-4.18]I could see the searchlight beams of the movie theater on the far side of the plaza.
MM_IN08_015_WAKE_13487=[0.14-1.75]The theater appeared to be closed.[2.38-4.07]Maybe the ticket could still get me in.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_ACTOR_13543=[0.00-0.53]Who’s there?[1.13-5.80]Look, you got the wrong guy.[5.80-7.03]I’m not Alex Casey.[7.03-9.42]I only play him in the movies.[10.42-12.64]He’s just a fictional character!
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_ACTOR_13545=[0.00-1.57]You don’t have to kill me.[1.64-5.61]You don't have to go get that knife and stab me.[6.59-8.31]You can just give up and go back.[8.64-13.85]Forget about the ritual sacrifice to open the way forward.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_ACTOR_13547=[0.00-0.57]No![0.60-1.49]Don’t do it![2.03-6.83]You don’t have to become a monster![7.29-11.70]Just leave the knife where it is in the back and go!
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_ACTOR_13550=[0.00-2.72]Let’s forget about the knife.[3.68-7.26]Don’t go looking for the knife.[8.70-10.73]There is no knife.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_ACTOR_13552=[0.05-0.98]Oh no![1.61-3.32]Oh no you don’t![3.86-5.27]You’ll be sorry!

MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13491=[0.00-4.45]I felt like I’d been on this case, looking for the Cult of the Word, [4.50-6.50]for a lifetime or more.[7.48-9.71]The only case I’d ever been on.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13492=[0.00-4.86]They would surface from the dark with their depraved acts of violence-[4.96-6.52]and fade back into the night, [6.84-9.90]leaving behind bloody crime scenes-[9.99-14.83]and clues heavy with obscure meanings that led nowhere.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13493=[0.00-8.12]Arriving at the cinema, I felt a monumental, terrifying revelation trembling before me.[9.18-12.96]Ready to open its jaws and swallow me whole.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13495=[0.00-2.82]It would do you a lot of good to talk, buddy.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13497=[0.03-1.31]Who’s your leader?[1.62-2.52]Alan Wake?[3.44-4.35]Scratch?[4.97-6.01]Zane?[6.42-7.91]Give me a name!
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13499=[0.09-5.65]The urban legends circling Tomas Zane were a bottomless rabbit hole.[6.94-8.33]I’d done some digging.[8.94-13.61]To film freaks he was a mythic auteur in the arthouse cinema.[14.11-18.44]A rising star, coming to America from Finland.[18.98-25.44]But he only created one film, Tom the Poet, before he went missing,[25.69-32.36]mirroring the vanishing of the main character in the movie, played by himself.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13500=[0.00-7.75]The biggest mystery was around his lost film, an early work made in Finland, Nightless Night, [7.95-11.54]rumored to have mystic properties.[11.82-17.80]Some claimed it was a snuff film, that the ritual murder in the film was an actual murder.[18.62-27.50]There were no known surviving copies, but the Cult chased it as if it was their unholy grail,[28.03-30.07]just like Wake’s books were.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13501=[0.05-4.34]Look at you, following your master into la-la-land.[4.71-10.88]A sad bunch of clowns in funny masks and hoods, pretending to be a secret society.

MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13517=[0.12-4.83]Don’t you fucking move, or I’ll blow you away.

MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13532=[0.00-2.79]I’m not the one wearing a mask here, you moron!
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13535=[0.03-2.66]That’s a real clever trick, asshole![3.31-5.06]You can run but you can’t hide!
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13536=[0.00-2.85]Why don’t you come say that to my face, buddy![3.19-4.84]Then we’ll see who’s the moron!
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13538=[0.03-0.85]Shut up![1.47-2.90]Shut the fuck up![3.05-4.04]Shut up!
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13539=[0.06-1.00]I’ll get you![1.21-3.54]I’ll get all of you fuckers!
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13559=[0.06-2.93]Everything out of your mouth is a damn lie.[3.16-7.22]The only place any of this makes sense is in your psychotic brain.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_13561=[0.00-3.38]I’m not going anywhere before I get some answers![3.89-5.68]How was I in that movie?[6.11-8.33]Why does this all feel so familiar?[8.69-10.18]Who the fuck are you?[10.18-13.06]Who the fuck am I?[13.94-15.30]No!
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_17940=[0.00-1.59]I’m here, you son of a bitch![1.86-2.95]Show yourself.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_17941=[0.06-1.98]The Grandmaster, my ass.[2.22-4.05]A clown in a mask.
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_17942=[0.03-2.66]That’s a real clever trick, asshole![3.31-5.06]You can run but you can’t hide!

MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_17944=[0.00-1.50]Who said that?
MM_IN08_020_CASEY_DP_17945=[0.00-2.79]I’m not the one wearing a mask here, you moron!
MM_IN08_020_CULTIST_ILMO_13496=[0.39-0.64]Haha.[2.72-4.80]It was an initiation ceremony.[5.50-7.78]Or so we made our “new members” believe.[8.21-9.67]Two of New York’s finest.[10.20-13.98]They had performed endless favors to earn their place among us.[14.24-16.87]We had something special waiting for them.[17.49-21.57]And something very special for you, Alex Casey.
MM_IN08_020_CULTIST_ILMO_13498=[0.06-4.48]You will meet him soon enough.
MM_IN08_020_CULTIST_ILMO_13502=[0.82-3.85]Maybe it is you who is playing a role, Mr. Casey.[3.85-6.61]A role carefully laid out for you.[6.94-12.20]A puppet blindly performing the ritual steps for the glory of the Cult.
MM_IN08_020_CULTIST_ILMO_13504=[0.00-1.63]Nightless Night.[2.16-4.25]A clip of the lost film survived.[4.74-6.58]You will see, Mr. Casey.[6.96-10.44]In the Nightless Night, you will finally see.
MM_IN08_020_CULTIST_ILMO_13518=[0.00-1.99]You got me, Mr. Casey.[2.87-4.06]I’m all yours.[4.16-4.90]Go ahead.[5.36-8.61]Ask that burning question in your mind.
MM_IN08_020_CULTIST_ILMO_13520=[0.00-1.17]You’ve seen the film?[1.52-5.23]Good, good, now you’re ready to meet the Grandmaster.[5.54-13.36]He’s waiting for you in the projection booth, where everything will be revealed, where he will project a new reality onto this one.[15.05-20.40]And now, Mr. Casey, I have played my part to the end.
MM_IN08_020_CULTIST_ILMO_13521=[0.00-7.97]Hahahahaha!
MM_IN08_020_DP_MULLIGAN_13511=[0.00-0.84]Nah.[1.67-6.06]I’m sure we’ll just chant some ceremonial stuff, nothing to it.
MM_IN08_020_DP_MULLIGAN_13513=[0.04-4.40]What we did or didn’t do, it’s all behind us now.[4.89-7.32]We’re going straight to the top, partner.
MM_IN08_020_DP_THORNTON_13510=[0.03-2.98]You don’t think they’re gonna want us to, like-cut off a finger or something, for this initiation, do ya?
MM_IN08_020_DP_THORNTON_13512=[0.16-1.33]It’s about time.[1.91-3.21]We paid our dues.[3.62-5.95]Made plenty of their problems disappear.[6.27-8.99]Dumped all those nobodies down that chute.
MM_IN08_020_DP_THORNTON_13514=[0.00-0.52]Yeah![0.83-3.28]Like we died and went to heaven!
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13489=[0.12-3.91]The cinema lobby was a gateway to other realities on the silver screen.[4.46-5.73]I could set a scene here.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13490=[0.05-1.47]The main event was the murder.[1.89-3.44]I had to find my way to it.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13494=[0.09-1.91]The first step toward the murder site.[2.21-3.49]I was making progress.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13505=[0.00-0.74]What is this?
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13506=[0.05-1.98]Zane was in the clip holding my lamp.[3.27-4.75]Was he playing me in his film?
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13507=[0.12-2.33]Zane’s lamp on the screen had no light.[2.99-5.50]I could transfer the light in my lamp to his.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13508=[0.22-3.49]The light of the lamp shone out of the screen and revealed a door.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13509=[0.06-1.57]I was back out in the night.[2.36-6.60]The seedy alley, away from prying eyes, was a good scene for dark deeds.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13515=[0.29-1.58]“Straight to the top".[2.17-4.21]The dirty cops looked down on the city.[4.72-5.50]Their city.[6.23-8.66]They had committed repulsive deeds to get there.[9.40-11.03]They told themselves it was worth it.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13516=[0.10-2.46]Someone had fallen to their death from the rooftop.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13524=[0.07-2.62]The Grandmaster had wanted Casey to go to him.[3.39-5.00]This was the way to the murder site.[5.63-6.96]It felt like an invitation.[7.43-8.69]How could I not accept.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13525=[0.08-3.02]I found myself in a maze of film equipment.[3.66-6.07]There had to be a way to the projection booth from here.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13526=[0.00-0.41]DELETE LINE
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13527=[0.08-1.08]I wasn’t alone.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13530=[0.06-1.43]I was back where I started.[1.89-3.10]A loop within a loop.[3.54-4.67]I had to keep going.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13533=[0.14-2.06]The Casey in the story was losing it.[2.98-4.27]I wasn’t far behind.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13534=[0.10-1.76]I was back at the beginning again.[2.12-5.16]I had to keep going, find a way to the murder site.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13537=[0.00-1.54]I was back at the beginning again.[2.37-5.43]I had to keep going, find a way to the murder site.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13540=[0.03-0.45]Hello?[0.79-1.18]Hey!
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13541=[0.15-0.58]Gone.[1.91-2.85]But I saw someone.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13542=[0.00-0.63]Casey?
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13544=[0.41-1.75]What’s going on here?
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13546=[0.03-1.96]The ritual sacrifice to open the way?
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13548=[0.08-1.26]The knife in the back?
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13549=[0.00-1.64]Everything about this was absurd.[2.11-6.34]Our dialogue forced and ridiculous, in desperate need of another pass.[7.11-9.02]But I’d play along to see where it took me.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13551=[0.00-0.61]The knife.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13553=[0.00-0.52]Damn.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13555=[0.30-0.84]Shit!
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13556=[0.00-0.91]What the fuck.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13557=[0.03-1.06]I was getting close.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13563=[0.00-0.82]What the hell?
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13565=[0.03-1.70]The visions were getting under my skin.[2.22-3.73]Coming too close for comfort.[4.39-8.16]Not a separate layer, but mingling with my own reality in the Dark Place.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13566=[0.03-0.66]Finally.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13567=[0.00-0.44]Wait.[0.79-2.36]A dead end.[3.29-4.14]This can’t be right.[4.74-5.62]Did I miss something?
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_13568=[0.12-1.62]The area had changed again.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_18200=[0.00-2.08]This place had significance to the Cult.[3.00-4.48]There was something to use there.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_18201=[0.03-1.90]There was no end to the corruption.[3.07-5.62]It fit the genre, so I’d use it.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_18202=[0.20-2.03]Nightless Night was Zane’s film.[2.96-4.46]It played a role in this story.
MM_IN08_020_WAKE_18203=[0.03-1.09]The projection booth.[1.83-3.43]Was that where I’d find the murder site?
MM_IN08_020_ZANE/SCRATCH_13558=[0.00-1.70]Welcome, Alex Casey.[2.16-3.09]You have done well.[4.01-5.84]You played your role perfectly.
MM_IN08_020_ZANE/SCRATCH_13560=[0.20-4.65]As a fictional character in a story, you have fulfilled you purpose.[5.30-7.17]You brought the writer of the story here.[8.29-10.04]You can go now, Casey.
MM_IN08_020_ZANE/SCRATCH_13562=[0.03-2.59]And welcome to you, Alan Wake.
MM_IN08_020_ZANE/SCRATCH_13564=[0.03-3.83]“This is the ritual to lead you on."[4.74-10.88]We are just one step away from your final destination, Mr. Wake.[11.71-25.67]But first, here’s an unanswered mystery for you: if Casey was fictional, and you assumed his role as the detective, are you now fictional too?[26.55-30.15]Whose story are you living, Mr. Wake?
MM_IN08_025_WAKE_13569=[0.05-0.91]The murder site.
MM_IN08_025_WAKE_13570=[0.03-1.15]The mask was the key.
MM_IN08_030_CASEY_DP_13581=[0.03-5.46]There wasn’t enough alcohol in this city to drown the memories of this nightmare,[5.69-7.89]but I’d damn well try.[8.79-14.36]This case would never be closed, I had more questions now than at the start, [14.87-20.47]the irony of being trapped in a postmodern detective story.
MM_IN08_030_CASEY_DP_13582=[0.03-6.49]I felt watched, the eyes of some unseen audience on me.[7.46-12.05]I wanted to turn to the hidden camera and tell them to fuck off-[12.24-16.82]but I didn’t know where to look to break the fourth wall.
MM_IN08_030_CASEY_DP_13583=[0.06-2.88]There would always be another case for Casey.[3.77-6.41]A million stories in this dark city.[7.49-9.90]The night opened up to welcome me.[10.81-12.78]I walked into her arms.[14.21-15.46]Roll credits.
MM_IN08_030_WAKE_13580=[0.11-1.43]Who was writing who?[2.53-3.68]Who was writing this poem?[4.61-5.00]Me?[5.95-6.45]No.
MM_IN08_035B_WAKE_13585=[0.14-3.44]My memorial statue had been replaced by a statue of Alice.[4.07-5.15]The thought sickened me.[5.69-7.27]Her life threatened by Scratch.[7.86-8.76]I had to hurry.
MM_IN08_035B_WAKE_13586=[0.12-1.61]The phone was ringing again.[2.29-4.40]Somehow I sensed it wasn’t Zane this time.
MM_IN08_035B_WAKE_13587=[0.03-0.82]It’s closed.[1.75-2.29]No.
MM_IN08_035B_WAKE_13588=[0.23-1.50]The building was condemned.[1.97-2.63]Closed up.[3.29-4.22]Something was wrong.[4.84-5.88]Something was missing.[6.61-7.78]I had to get inside.
MM_IN08_035B_WAKE_13589=[0.19-2.45]How many writers does it take to finish a story?[3.29-4.43]One for each draft.[5.24-7.72]It’s the same writer, but in a different point in time.[8.30-10.23]I’d follow the steps he laid out for me.
MM_IN08_035B_WAKE_13590=[0.11-2.64]Alice’s photos from the talk show building basement.[3.10-4.29]Ahti had guided me there.[4.95-7.45]I’d bring the photos to the shoebox by the statue.
MM_IN08_035B_WAKE_13591=[0.22-2.56]Alice’s photos from the talk show building basement?[2.98-4.34]I had to go back to get them.[4.78-7.20]I’d bring the photos to the shoebox by the statue.
MM_IN08_035B_WAKE_13592=[0.13-1.34]I had the photos now.[1.88-4.40]I needed to put them into the shoebox by the statue.
MM_IN08_ADDITIONAL_01_WAKE_13458=[0.00-4.87]The cops had gotten their fifteen minutes of fame with the cult, and it’d been a scream.[5.54-6.88]They were the murder victims.
MM_IN08_ADDITIONAL_01_WAKE_13459=[0.03-2.49]I had to find a way into the Projection Booth somehow.
MM_IN08_ADDITIONAL_02_WAKE_13460=[0.03-1.54]A film that was a ritual.[2.14-3.47]Literal movie magic.[4.01-8.07]In a theater that hailed from a time when there was still magic in the silver screen.
MM_IN08_ADDITIONAL_03_WAKE_13461=[0.00-5.22]In the city trapped in eternal night, they watched the film where the night never arrives-[5.76-7.37]where the night hides in your mind.
MM_IN08_ADDITIONAL_04B_WAKE_13462=[0.03-0.20]Ah![0.40-0.83]Shit.
MM_IN08_ADDITIONAL_05B_WAKE_13463=[0.00-0.83]Fuck off.
MM_IN09_005_WAKE_14375=[0.03-2.08]I’d been here many times before.[2.72-3.81]I didn’t know how many.[4.45-5.39]This felt different.[6.02-7.12]Like my last chance.[7.81-9.26]If it wasn’t already too late.
MM_IN09_010_WAKE_5759=[0.08-1.56]Nobody lived here anymore.[2.23-3.16]Was I too late?
MM_IN09_010_WAKE_5760=[0.10-3.07]Scratch was in there, writing his horror story.[3.74-5.42]There was still time to stop him.[5.76-7.18]I needed to get inside.

MM_RE01_005_SAGA_12044=[0.00-1.61]Better see what the deputy has for me.
MM_RE01_005_SAGA_12045=[0.00-1.25]Need to head to the crime scene.[1.88-2.93]No time to waste.
MM_RE01_005_SAGA_4151=[0.03-3.03]A deputy was supposed to be here to show us to the crime scene.[4.20-6.61]There’s the car, so where’s the deputy?
MM_RE01_005_SAGA_6937=[0.03-0.96]I think I hear someone.[2.15-3.24]Could be our deputy.
MM_RE01_005_SAGA_6942=[0.40-2.43]”The Federal Bureau of Control”.[3.38-4.07]That’s a new one.[5.23-7.51]“Toxic volcanic gas” huh?
MM_RE01_005_SAGA_6944=[0.11-2.46]What’s so unusual about volcanic gas?
MM_RE01_005_THORNTON_6938=[0.08-1.68]I didn’t want us to switch![1.68-2.92]I never said that, Mulligan![3.24-6.74]I said we should both be down here, watching this dead guy.[6.94-8.19]For safety!
MM_RE01_010_CASEY_12046=[0.00-2.17]Fucking nature.[2.87-4.04]Gives me a headache.[4.74-6.30]Too much sky.
MM_RE01_010_CASEY_12052=[0.26-1.91]I’m not that old.
MM_RE01_010_CASEY_12906=[0.03-0.86]Sounds like a plan.
MM_RE01_010_CASEY_12908=[0.00-0.33]Got it.
MM_RE01_010_CASEY_12910=[0.00-0.43]Roger.
MM_RE01_010_CASEY_12912=[0.00-0.78]I’ll wait here.
MM_RE01_010_CASEY_12914=[0.00-1.05]Take your time.
MM_RE01_010_CASEY_12916=[0.00-1.11]You know where to find me.
MM_RE01_010_CASEY_4156=[0.07-2.71]I see you’re already hard at work, Anderson.[3.66-4.80]Close to cracking it?
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_12047=[0.03-2.18]Agoraphobia acting up, Casey?
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_12048=[0.03-1.76]I should take a minute to review the case.
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_12049=[0.03-1.88]I need to be sure I know all the facts.
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_12050=[0.00-1.94]I need to think through the facts of the case.
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_12051=[0.03-0.77]Stairs are out.[1.49-2.62]You okay to jump down?
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_12905=[0.03-2.00]He said the crime scene is just down the hill.[2.00-3.18]At an old convenience store.[3.91-4.39]Let’s go.
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_12907=[0.06-1.18]I’m gonna go check something out.[1.18-2.58]I’ll be right back.
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_12909=[0.04-1.11]I’ll be back in a second.
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_12911=[0.00-1.15]Think I saw something.[2.20-3.11]Will only take a minute.
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_12913=[0.00-0.66]I’ll look around.[1.26-1.96]See you in a bit.
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_12915=[0.03-1.46]I want to walk around for a minute.
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_4157=[0.00-3.50]Before we get to the crime scene, there’s time to review the facts of the case so far.[4.24-6.08]Make sure I’m seeing the clues clearly.
MM_RE01_010_SAGA_4158=[0.07-1.29]We’re just getting started.[2.00-3.62]Let’s head down the hill, to the crime scene.
MM_RE01_015_CASEY_4175=[0.00-0.95]No tarp.[1.59-2.84]You owe me a coffee.
MM_RE01_015_MULLIGAN_6946=[0.13-2.18]Nope, still not getting it.[2.60-4.41]Try explaining it one more time.
MM_RE01_015_SAGA_4166=[0.63-2.87]Deputy Thornton, I take it?
MM_RE01_015_SAGA_4169=[0.11-1.08]Thanks, deputy.
MM_RE01_015_SAGA_4171=[0.63-2.87]Deputy Thornton, I take it?
MM_RE01_015_SAGA_6948=[0.14-2.73]Okay, let’s start by examining our guest of honor.
MM_RE01_015_SAGA_6949=[0.00-2.44]Does this fit the MO of the previous murders?
MM_RE01_015_THORNTON_4164=[0.28-2.75]Look, I meant BOTH of us would be HERE.[3.03-4.81]You and me here, together.[4.90-6.24]At the murder site.[6.46-8.44]I did not want to swap.
MM_RE01_015_THORNTON_4165=[0.48-0.86]Hey![0.86-1.07]Hey!
MM_RE01_015_THORNTON_4167=[0.55-4.33]That’s me, at your service, ready to get this case solved![4.74-6.33]The body is behind the store.[6.52-7.63]Come on, I’ll show ya.
MM_RE01_015_THORNTON_4168=[0.03-1.89]This is the scene of the crime.[2.16-5.34]We found him on the table, didn’t touch nothing.[5.52-7.66]You know, procedures and...[8.11-9.10]stuff.
MM_RE01_015_THORNTON_4170=[0.03-0.15]Hey![0.62-1.34]Hey!
MM_RE01_015_THORNTON_4172=[0.31-1.78]Yeah, that’s me.[2.42-4.52]Mulligan told me you were coming the other way.
MM_RE01_015_THORNTON_6947=[0.00-2.02]How much clearer can I make it, Mulligan?
MM_RE01_020_CASEY_12920=[0.78-1.94]Anything clicking yet?
MM_RE01_020_CASEY_18601=[0.00-0.41]Hm.[1.19-2.08]Good eye.
MM_RE01_020_CASEY_18603=[0.00-0.90]Hard to say.
MM_RE01_020_CASEY_18606=[0.00-0.41]Hm.[1.19-2.08]Good eye.
MM_RE01_020_CASEY_18608=[0.00-0.90]Hard to say.
MM_RE01_020_CASEY_6951=[0.03-2.87]Want to start by inspecting the body, Anderson?
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_12124=[0.00-4.16]Was he killed here or brought here after, for display?
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_12917=[0.00-4.11]Incised-stab wound, chest cut open, heart removed.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_12918=[0.03-2.04]The killer left the heart right next to the body.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_12919=[0.03-0.95]I think that’s everything.[1.55-2.42]For now, at least.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_12921=[0.00-0.61]Not sure.[1.71-2.77]Need to think about it.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_12922=[0.03-1.31]I had to review the clues.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_16106=[0.03-1.31]Multiple people were here.[1.96-3.01]Multiple killers?
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_16107=[0.03-1.45]Large amount of blood on the table.[2.89-4.13]The victim died here.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_16108=[0.14-3.87]Someone left in a hurry, knocked the tripod over.[5.57-6.59]Was it for a camera?
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_16109=[0.03-1.05]Someone was drinking beer.[1.98-4.38]They spent time here, waiting.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_16110=[0.00-2.69]Bruising on the wrists from the cargo straps holding him down.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_18599=[0.00-1.71]This carving looks fresh.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_18600=[0.00-1.56]We’ve seen this symbol before.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_18602=[0.00-1.73]Think the symbol is connected to the murder?
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_18604=[0.00-1.81]A creepy twig sculpture.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_18605=[0.00-1.56]We’ve seen this symbol before.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_18607=[0.00-1.73]Think this symbol is connected to the murder?
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_18609=[0.00-1.35]They left a lot of garbage.[2.18-3.67]Not the fastidious type.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_4176=[0.00-1.92]Body is positioned on the table.[3.07-4.01]Ritualistic.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_6950=[0.05-2.54]Step one, examine the corpse.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_6952=[0.03-0.92]Who is our victim?[1.86-2.62]Who killed him?[4.18-5.30]Need to find more clues.
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_6955=[0.00-1.96]Did they plan for the murder to happen here?
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_6956=[0.00-2.04]What was going on with Nightingale?
MM_RE01_020_SAGA_6957=[0.00-1.12]Get inside his head.[1.95-2.72]Profile him.
MM_RE01_020_THORNTON_4174=[0.37-4.02]Never actually seen the FBI investigate a murder victim before.[4.41-5.73]Except in the movies.
MM_RE01_030A_CASEY_12926=[0.06-2.81]That seems pretty complicated to me.[3.56-6.34]What was this guy doing skinny dipping this time of year?
MM_RE01_030A_CASEY_12930=[0.08-0.82]Hm.[1.44-2.92]Lots of questions.
MM_RE01_030A_CASEY_12934=[0.03-3.79]I didn’t know trees got that big.[5.33-6.65]Gives me the creeps.
MM_RE01_030A_CASEY_4183=[0.11-1.21]Makes no sense.
MM_RE01_030A_CASEY_6959=[0.03-1.09]Sounds good.[1.18-2.69]This way, right?
MM_RE01_030A_CASEY_6962=[0.03-1.73]This one of your hunches, Anderson?[2.24-3.60]Did something happen at the lake?
MM_RE01_030A_CASEY_6964=[0.03-3.27]When you’re ready, I’d love to hear what you’ve put together so far.
MM_RE01_030A_CASEY_6967=[0.00-0.64]Hmmm.
MM_RE01_030A_SAGA_12923=[0.06-0.43]Right.
MM_RE01_030A_SAGA_12925=[0.03-0.37]Sure.[1.70-3.06]It’s not that complicated.[4.44-7.42]Nightingale was out in the woods, alone, at night, possibly nude.[8.10-10.50]The killers knew he was here, ambushed him,[10.81-14.36]dragged him to the campgrounds, strapped him to the table, cut his heart out-[15.24-17.59]but then they were interrupted by those witnesses, the Bookers.[18.89-20.06]The job is unfinished.
MM_RE01_030A_SAGA_12928=[0.03-1.80]I haven’t figured that part out yet.
MM_RE01_030A_SAGA_12935=[0.00-1.28]You need to get out more.[1.28-4.77]It is kind of creepy though.
MM_RE01_030A_SAGA_4182=[0.06-0.60]Tracks.[1.17-1.89]Barefoot.[2.76-3.60]Nightingale’s?[4.96-6.47]They come out from under the boulder.
MM_RE01_030A_SAGA_6958=[0.00-2.22]The lake is connected to Nightingale somehow.
MM_RE01_030A_SAGA_6960=[0.00-2.33]Casey, let’s take a look down by the lake.[3.27-3.92]Lead the way.
MM_RE01_030A_SAGA_6963=[0.03-3.67]I think Nightingale came up from that direction, from the lake.[4.76-7.42]Probably looking for shelter, safety.[8.86-9.93]They were waiting for him.
MM_RE01_030A_SAGA_6965=[0.03-1.65]Lots of answers for us to find.
MM_RE01_030A_SAGA_6966=[0.04-1.73]A witch with no heart.[2.76-4.49]A strange echo of our murder.
MM_RE01_030A_SAGA_6968=[0.00-1.37]There’s a piece of paper on the ground.
MM_RE01_030A_THORNTON_6961=[0.05-3.19]Okay! Well, I'll just, uh, I'll just wait here.
MM_RE01_030B_CASEY_4186=[0.10-2.45]Playing a sick game with us.
MM_RE01_030B_SAGA_12936=[0.03-1.79]I need to examine the page for clues.
MM_RE01_030B_SAGA_12937=[0.00-1.82]I should profile Nightingale about this page.
MM_RE01_030B_SAGA_4185=[0.00-1.30]Someone’s been watching us.
MM_RE01_030B_SAGA_4187=[0.20-0.97]You were right.[2.10-3.53]This is right up my alley.
MM_RE01_030B_SAGA_6969=[0.00-1.34]Nightingale came this way.[2.67-6.30]Either he dropped this page, or the killers left it for us.
MM_RE01_040_CASEY_12940=[0.06-4.74]So essentially we’re standing in the gaping maw of hell.
MM_RE01_040_CASEY_12942=[0.04-2.24]Cheating on a science fair.[2.99-5.02]That’s almost a crime, Anderson.
MM_RE01_040_CASEY_4189=[0.03-1.21]I hate all of it.[2.23-4.54]The text said we’d find more.[4.89-5.92]I believe it.
MM_RE01_040_CASEY_4191=[0.03-1.80]It’s all about control.[2.22-4.01]Deciding what happens to who.[4.43-6.27]Don’t let it drag you in.
MM_RE01_040_SAGA_12938=[0.00-0.77]Too late.[0.85-2.09]I’m already hooked.[2.69-4.01]I need the next chapter.
MM_RE01_040_SAGA_12939=[0.00-3.32]Did you know this entire area is inside a caldera?[4.78-7.52]This whole mountain used to be an active volcano.[8.60-11.24]Imagine the force it took to carve this crater out of the earth.[12.41-14.94]Calderas are pretty rare so be sure to take it in.
MM_RE01_040_SAGA_12941=[0.00-1.09]You got it.[2.34-4.82]I used to love geology when I was in school.[5.55-9.18]I helped Logan build a great baking soda volcano for her science fair.
MM_RE01_040_SAGA_12943=[0.09-2.52]I’m not going to say no to quality time with a volcano.[3.11-3.77]I mean, my daughter.
MM_RE01_040_SAGA_4188=[0.00-3.24]Casey, I think something’s been put inside Nightingale’s body.[3.79-6.16]Let’s tell the deputies to get the body to the town morgue.
MM_RE01_040_SAGA_4190=[0.03-2.77]Whoever wrote that page made sure it read like a story.[3.66-5.18]Like a scene from a thriller.
MM_RE01_040_SAGA_6970=[0.00-0.92]But what’s the purpose?[1.84-4.18]They’re twisting events to create their own narrative to do...[4.77-5.29]what?[6.42-7.82]Entertain some fantasy?[8.68-10.52]Projecting their desires?[11.73-13.39]Are we characters or the audience?[14.20-15.74]Witnesses to their design?[16.86-17.78]All of the above?
MM_RE01_040_THORNTON_12944=[0.05-1.79]Hey, you made it back.[2.03-2.60]Good!
MM_RE01_040_THORNTON_49598=[0.00-2.61]Hope you didn’t get stuck in any of those big puddles.[2.98-6.55]Crazy flooding down there, huh, just like I said.
MM_RE01_045_CASEY_12946=[0.03-0.46]Sounds good.
MM_RE01_045_CASEY_12948=[0.12-2.63]Now you’re just being mean, Anderson.
MM_RE01_045_CASEY_12950=[0.00-2.07]Not a surprise about the deputies.[2.70-5.09]Doubt they see much stuff this gruesome.
MM_RE01_045_CASEY_4194=[0.03-1.63]At the diner, right?[1.84-3.50]I could use a cup of coffee.
MM_RE01_045_CASEY_4200=[0.03-5.88]Before we go, shouldn’t we tell Laurel and Hardy to haul the body over to the town morgue?
MM_RE01_045_FBC_AGENT_4198=[0.26-2.75]The station heads are not currently available.[3.27-5.94]Access is restricted without their permission.
MM_RE01_045_MULLIGAN_12952=[0.00-2.21]Thornton told me we’re shipping the body out.[2.21-5.76]We’ll get that taken care of for ya, don’t worry about that.[5.98-7.63]Proper police work.[8.32-10.94]You can trust us like you can trust the...[10.94-11.44]uh...[11.69-12.51]the...
MM_RE01_045_MULLIGAN_12954=[0.03-1.84]That was beautiful, Thornton.
MM_RE01_045_SAGA_12054=[0.03-0.46]Locked.[1.07-2.87]They really don’t want people coming in here.
MM_RE01_045_SAGA_12055=[0.00-0.83]Can’t go any further.[1.71-2.62]Water’s too deep.
MM_RE01_045_SAGA_12945=[0.03-1.91]Let’s try that shortcut the deputy mentioned.
MM_RE01_045_SAGA_12947=[0.03-2.99]Seems like a nice town so far, murders aside.[3.66-4.39]Pretty woods.[5.29-6.68]Cute lodge we got set up in.[7.67-9.18]We should go for a hike if we get a chance.
MM_RE01_045_SAGA_12949=[0.00-4.28]The deputies aren’t exactly up to the task, but hopefully the sheriff will be more helpful.
MM_RE01_045_SAGA_12951=[0.00-0.63]Here we are.[1.91-4.07]Let’s drive back to town and meet the sheriff at the diner.
MM_RE01_045_SAGA_4193=[0.06-4.70]Let’s get the car, drive to Bright Falls, and talk to these witnesses, the Bookers.
MM_RE01_045_SAGA_4197=[0.00-0.32]Hello?[0.32-3.57]This is Agent Anderson and Agent Casey, FBI.[3.81-7.25]We’d like to come in, ask you a few questions pertaining to an investigation.
MM_RE01_045_SAGA_4199=[0.00-1.56]Nice talking to you too.
MM_RE01_045_SAGA_4201=[0.93-4.89]I think you need to update your references but yes, you’re right.
MM_RE01_045_THORNTON_12953=[0.12-2.34]The blossoming checker lilies in Spring.
MM_RE01_050_CASEY_12955=[0.04-1.30]I smell coffee.
MM_RE01_050_CASEY_18611=[0.09-2.56]Not exactly hiding in the shadows, are they?
MM_RE01_050_CASEY_4215=[0.03-1.30]“Oh Deer”.[2.18-3.14]Cute.
MM_RE01_050_SAGA_18610=[0.00-2.29]This is the same symbol as that Cult necklace.
MM_RE01_050_SAGA_4212=[0.03-1.53]The diner’s just up the waterfront.[2.18-4.28]Shouldn’t keep the sheriff and our witnesses waiting.
MM_RE01_050_TIM_4216=[0.97-3.02]Let me guess, the FBI.[3.33-5.12]Welcome to Bright Falls.[6.14-7.04]Nice to have you here.
MM_RE01_050_TIM_6971=[0.07-1.02]Got you both some coffee.[2.19-3.02]Washington’s finest.
MM_RE01_055_SAGA_12956=[0.00-0.48]Busted.[1.32-2.35]Too bad.[3.19-4.45]It’s a beautiful machine.
MM_RE01_060_SAGA_6972=[0.03-1.81]I need the necklace Tammy found.[2.56-3.35]It’s evidence.
MM_RE01_070_CASEY_4235=[0.00-1.36]A murder cult.[2.28-3.37]Fuck.
MM_RE01_070_MULLIGAN_4236=[0.14-0.64]Hey, boss.[1.25-2.93]Corpse is downstairs, ready to go.
MM_RE01_070_SAGA_4234=[0.03-0.47]Let’s go.
MM_RE01_070_SAGA_4237=[0.03-2.19]I’d like to take a closer look as soon as possible.[2.97-3.92]Lead the way, sheriff.
MM_RE01_070_SAGA_6973=[0.03-1.76]Well, Casey, I got a lead.[2.50-4.16]Looks like we’re dealing with a cult.[5.05-6.35]The Cult of the Tree.
MM_RE01_070_THORNTON_6974=[0.00-1.97]Yeah, in the morgue, all prepped.
MM_RE01_070_TIM_4233=[0.00-0.45]All set?[1.15-3.93]My guys have Nightingale at the morgue if you’re ready to go take a look.
MM_RE01_075_SAGA_4243=[0.03-1.68]We appreciate the support, sheriff.
MM_RE01_075_SAGA_6975=[0.00-2.59]I’m qualified to perform examinations, yes.
MM_RE01_075_TIM_4241=[0.00-1.66]This is the Bright Falls Sheriff’s Station.[2.17-4.32]Anything you need, just let us know.
MM_RE01_075_TIM_4242=[0.07-1.87]We share a morgue with the funeral home next door.[1.94-2.95]Shoestring budget.[4.32-5.95]Guess you don’t have that problem though.
MM_RE01_075_TIM_4244=[0.03-2.93]Our only coroner rotates between a few other towns, and he’s away this week.[2.93-4.11]But you can handle this, right?
MM_RE01_080_CASEY_18612=[0.05-1.30]Defensive wounds.[1.90-3.05]He put up a fight.
MM_RE01_080_CASEY_18615=[0.03-1.53]Solid hunch, Anderson.
MM_RE01_080_CASEY_18617=[0.00-3.34]Nightingale didn’t strike me as a tattoo guy.
MM_RE01_080_CASEY_18619=[0.18-0.86]Writing?[1.86-3.39]How’d they manage that?
MM_RE01_080_CASEY_6976=[0.03-3.70]Something about morgues, they always cheer me up.
MM_RE01_080_SAGA_18613=[0.00-3.50]The body shows signs of being submerged in water post-mortem.[5.68-6.70]It doesn’t add up.
MM_RE01_080_SAGA_18614=[0.00-0.54]Ah-ha.[1.75-3.62]They did leave something inside his chest.
MM_RE01_080_SAGA_18616=[0.00-1.35]This looks like text.[2.73-3.30]A tattoo?
MM_RE01_080_SAGA_18618=[0.00-1.16]There’s writing on here.[2.96-4.03]Can’t make it out.
MM_RE01_080_SAGA_6978=[0.11-0.85]He’s joking.
MM_RE01_080_SAGA_6979=[0.03-0.50]Okay![1.44-2.86]Let’s take a look at our patient.
MM_RE01_080_SAGA_6980=[0.00-3.82]I’ll start with an external inspection, before performing the internal examination.
MM_RE01_080_SAGA_6981=[0.00-1.34]What was the cause of death?[2.33-4.18]What other clues can the body give me?
MM_RE01_080_SAGA_6982=[0.03-2.01]Something is hidden inside his chest.[2.93-3.97]Time to take a look.
MM_RE01_080_TIM_6977=[0.03-1.30]Can’t say I feel the same.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_6994=[0.20-4.28]I’ll get you.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_6995=[0.12-3.86]I’ll find you.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_6996=[0.07-5.37]I flick the switch, it goes “click”.[7.09-16.23]Show me the Clicker.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_6997=[0.14-1.51]Lights are off.[5.56-9.97]But somebody’s home.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_6998=[0.00-2.92]Hemingway brought you here, witch.[5.99-14.65]Get out of my house.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7007=[0.04-1.48]A wave of terror.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7008=[0.03-1.45]Waiting for her.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7009=[0.03-1.73]Drowning everything.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7010=[0.09-1.78]Was, but wasn’t.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7011=[0.03-1.61]A monster.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7012=[0.03-0.74]Killing.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7013=[0.00-1.16]Here he was.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7014=[0.03-2.50]Eyes behind a deer mask.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7015=[0.00-1.66]Pulled from darkness.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7016=[0.03-1.24]A coffee thermos.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7017=[0.00-1.63]You’re in over your head.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7018=[0.00-1.62]He was risen.
MM_RE01_085_NIGHTINGALE_7019=[0.00-2.20]Premium cabins for rent.
MM_RE01_085_SAGA_6999=[0.43-1.83]I need to get into the light.[2.29-2.79]Now.
MM_RE01_085_SAGA_7000=[0.00-0.51]He’s coming.[1.57-2.78]Need to be in the light.
MM_RE01_085_SAGA_7001=[0.00-1.74]He can’t see me in the light.
MM_RE01_085_SAGA_7002=[0.00-1.58]Need to get my gun back.[2.28-3.69]Can’t fight him without it.
MM_RE01_085_SAGA_7003=[0.00-0.90]Need to get my gun.
MM_RE01_085_SAGA_7004=[0.03-1.63]Won’t stand a chance without my weapon.
MM_RE01_085_SAGA_7005=[0.00-1.38]He knocked my gun out of the room.[2.23-3.07]Need to find it.
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_12058=[0.00-1.88]The heart is gone too.[2.70-4.24]Did the fucker take it with him?
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_12059=[0.15-1.72]Did you check out the town, Anderson?
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_12061=[0.04-0.85]Waiting on you.
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_12958=[0.00-0.89]See you in a bit.
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_4262=[0.00-4.31]He just disappeared?[4.53-7.51]What the hell is going on here?
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_4271=[0.03-2.29]They’re a fine pair.
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_4272=[0.05-1.61]Agent Casey here.[1.87-2.13]Yeah.[2.74-3.82]We need back up.[3.82-5.05]The Bright Falls case.[5.60-7.04]Whoever you can spare.[7.55-8.31]ASAP.
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_4274=[0.05-3.77]We can’t assume the person writing these pages isn’t playing us.
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_7020=[0.00-1.59]There’s one of those pages on the floor.
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_7023=[0.00-0.56]Okay.
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_7029=[0.14-1.38]Smart choice, Anderson.
MM_RE01_090_CASEY_7030=[0.05-2.38]Think we’ll actually find Nightingale at the lake?
MM_RE01_090_MULLIGAN_4265=[0.06-0.26]Hey![0.39-1.54]We heard gunshots.[1.54-2.31]You all okay?
MM_RE01_090_MULLIGAN_4267=[0.00-1.93]But, uh, that’s crazy, right, Thornton?[3.01-4.70]Nightingale’s heart was missing.[5.20-8.18]How could he do anything, he’s dead.
MM_RE01_090_MULLIGAN_4269=[0.00-5.65]No, Thornton, monsters aren’t real and magic’s definitely not real!
MM_RE01_090_MULLIGAN_49630=Oh...
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_12060=[0.00-0.97]Just getting my bearings.[1.78-2.29]Ready to go?
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_12957=[0.00-1.30]I’m going to take a quick look around.[1.78-2.66]Meet you back at the car.
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_18620=[0.04-2.18]The Cult doesn’t see their victims as people.
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_4260=[0.00-3.40]He didn’t have a heart, but he still got up.[4.04-5.56]The page predicted all of it.[6.23-7.33]It helped me fight him.
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_4261=[0.03-2.45]We need to figure that out if we’re going to do anything about it.[3.05-5.08]Somehow we need to make sense of this.
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_4263=[0.00-1.39]These pages are important.[1.87-3.72]Breaker dropped one before he disappeared.
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_4268=[0.30-1.58]Sheriff Breaker disappeared.[1.91-5.22]Nightingale turned into some sort of monster and there are officers down.[5.78-6.94]You two handle things here.[6.94-9.03]We need to get back to Cauldron Lake immediately.
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_4273=[0.03-1.49]The pages haven’t been wrong yet.
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_7022=[0.04-3.10]The page places Nightingale back at Cauldron Lake.[4.01-5.25]Calls him a “Taken”.[7.14-10.33]We need to head over there, stop him before anyone else gets hurt.
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_7027=[0.05-1.39]Sorry, we need to go.[1.96-3.24]I’m counting on you, deputies.
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_7028=[0.00-2.02]Nightingale and this cult are dangerous.[2.68-5.72]We need to be prepared in case things escalate more than they already have.[6.78-7.86]Can you call it in, Casey?
MM_RE01_090_SAGA_7031=[0.03-2.42]I agree, but it’s our best lead.
MM_RE01_090_THORNTON_4266=[0.00-1.69]Did ya get spooked by the bodies?
MM_RE01_090_THORNTON_4270=[0.09-1.35]Yeah, right![2.21-4.97]That’s all crazy talk.[5.63-6.64]Monsters aren’t real.[6.64-10.07]And what do you mean the sheriff disappeared?[10.21-11.70]Like, poof, he’s gone?[11.70-12.52]Like magic?[13.12-14.34]Magic’s not real.
MM_RE01_090_THORNTON_7024=[0.00-2.78]Fuck me, that’s terrible.[3.39-5.10]We’ll do what we can, ma’am.
MM_RE01_090_THORNTON_7025=[0.08-2.97]Magic’s not real, right, Mulligan?
MM_RE01_090_THORNTON_7026=[0.00-2.15]I knew that!
MM_RE02_005_CASEY_12062=[0.00-1.19]Guess we’re not alone.
MM_RE02_005_CASEY_12979=[0.04-1.15]If you say so.
MM_RE02_005_CASEY_7232=[0.00-2.37]I’m happy I’m not in charge of this mess.
MM_RE02_005_CASEY_7236=[0.00-3.00]In my experience, they don’t.
MM_RE02_005_CASEY_7239=[0.00-3.60]Those restricted area signs don’t do a damn thing, huh.
MM_RE02_005_ILMO_7238=[0.00-0.58]Hey![0.74-1.53]Hello there![1.96-3.35]How are you folks doing?
MM_RE02_005_SAGA_12063=[0.09-0.73]Great.[1.43-3.64]This area is supposed to be closed to the public.
MM_RE02_005_SAGA_12977=[0.00-2.21]Let’s start looking for Nightingale  where he was killed.
MM_RE02_005_SAGA_12978=[0.03-2.43]Casey, you go ahead to the murder site.[2.88-3.51]I’ll catch up.
MM_RE02_005_SAGA_12980=[0.03-2.03]The writer of these pages knows what will happen.[2.85-5.80]Because they’re behind this, or because they can see what’s coming?
MM_RE02_005_SAGA_12981=[0.05-1.77]Impossible things are happening here.[2.42-4.35]A world operating on different rules.[6.15-8.18]I need to understand this strange logic.[9.12-10.14]To see the clues.[11.32-12.24]To solve the case.
MM_RE02_005_SAGA_12982=[0.05-1.72]Let’s get to the murder site, Casey.
MM_RE02_005_SAGA_7231=[0.03-3.16]The page says Nightingale is in something called an Overlap.[4.13-6.61]Need to figure out exactly what that means.
MM_RE02_005_SAGA_7233=[0.00-0.62]Thanks.
MM_RE02_005_SAGA_7234=[0.00-1.57]Where is Nightingale hiding?[2.87-4.10]Where is the Overlap?
MM_RE02_005_SAGA_7235=[0.03-2.07]I’ve been thinking more about the Cult of the Tree.[3.24-7.37]What sort of cult refers to themselves as a cult?
MM_RE02_005_SAGA_7237=[0.04-1.72]We’re not seeing the full picture yet.
MM_RE02_010_CASEY_12984=[0.00-3.33]He was about to give you more of those pages.[4.50-6.69]Something didn’t want us to have them?[7.41-10.77]Or was protecting him from Nightingale?[11.69-13.25]Spontaneous combustion?[13.25-13.90]I don’t know.[13.90-17.95]Not the kind of disappearance we normally solve.
MM_RE02_010_CASEY_14287=[0.03-2.23]Maybe something around here will tell us.
MM_RE02_010_CASEY_14289=[0.06-0.56]Got it.
MM_RE02_010_CASEY_7244=[0.00-1.61]Our crime scene’s drowning.[1.61-4.04]I never minded rain.[4.89-6.92]Feels like home.
MM_RE02_010_CASEY_7248=[0.00-0.57]On it.[1.10-3.08]If anything comes up, I’ll radio you.
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_12983=[0.03-5.53]A lot of things about this case keep bothering me, but one thing feels really off.[6.48-7.79]Breaker’s disappearance.[10.33-12.71]I don’t get the feeling Nightingale was responsible.
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_12985=[0.04-1.38]Fancy meeting you here.
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_12986=[0.06-1.32]Rain’s getting worse.
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_14288=[0.00-4.55]Casey, you look for any further clues here and I’ll check the rest of the area.[4.81-6.58]You see anything, radio me.
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_14290=[0.00-1.58]The tracks lead into the water.[2.73-3.91]Where’d he go from here?
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_14291=[0.00-1.48]The footprints disappear in the water.[2.93-3.93]Where’d he go?
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_14292=[0.00-2.16]I need to figure out where Nightingale went.
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_16139=[0.03-0.96]I can feel something.[2.29-3.02]A presence.[5.19-6.43]Nightingale isn’t far.
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_7245=[0.00-1.18]No sign of Nightingale.[1.90-5.58]But the page did place him at Cauldron Lake, in an “Overlap”.
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_7246=[0.03-1.58]So how do we follow him there?
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_7247=[0.03-1.54]I’ll see where these footprints lead.[2.04-5.63]Can you comb through the crime scene one more time, Casey, just in case?
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_7249=[0.04-0.95]Bare feet.[1.81-2.54]Nightingale.
MM_RE02_010_SAGA_7250=[0.00-1.56]“The tree was a threshold".[3.43-4.82]I need to check out Witch’s Ladle.
MM_RE02_015_SAGA_12987=[0.00-1.58]Dark history around here.[2.54-4.26]Even darker folktales.[5.58-9.40]Probably wasn’t a witch at all, just didn’t take the sheriff’s crap.
MM_RE02_015_SAGA_14293=[0.00-0.96]What is that?[1.84-3.88]Seems like it’s reacting to the light.
MM_RE02_015_SAGA_14297=[0.00-1.71]These aren’t the same tracks that were here before.[2.49-4.83]They’re headed into the tree, not out of it.
MM_RE02_015_SAGA_7251=[0.03-2.14]My flashlight burned the dark stuff away.[3.51-4.93]It was covering another page.
MM_RE02_015_SAGA_7253=[0.00-0.88]The Witch’s Hut.[1.84-2.34]Okay.[3.51-5.52]I trust the pages to lead me to the Overlap.
MM_RE02_015_SAGA_7254=[0.03-1.50]I need to find the Witch’s Hut.
MM_RE02_015_WAKE_7252=[0.00-1.19]The fuse was in place.[2.45-4.26]Saga stepped inside the Witch’s Hut.[4.88-6.48]Inside, a bright light.[7.07-8.74]And objects that stood out to Saga.[9.21-10.93]As if the light had manifested them.
MM_RE02_020_CASEY_7255=[0.00-3.08]Anderson, thought I saw something in the woods.[3.53-5.51]Probably just a deer, but I’m gonna check it out.
MM_RE02_020_CASEY_7257=[0.00-0.60]Roger.
MM_RE02_020_SAGA_12064=[0.00-0.82]No fuse here.
MM_RE02_020_SAGA_12065=[0.05-1.25]This fuse is busted.
MM_RE02_020_SAGA_12066=[0.03-1.09]This one looks good.[1.23-3.32]People should really stop littering though.
MM_RE02_020_SAGA_13992=[0.04-1.82]The fuse box is missing a fuse.[3.06-5.16]I need to find one to turn on the lights.
MM_RE02_020_SAGA_7256=[0.03-0.39]Okay.[0.92-2.18]I found another page.[2.76-3.84]Following up on a lead.[4.29-5.08]Keep checking in.
MM_RE02_020_SAGA_7258=[0.03-1.11]This is the Witch’s Hut.
MM_RE02_020_SAGA_7259=[0.06-1.98]The page described the hut being lit.[2.79-4.04]And mentioned a fuse...
MM_RE02_020_SAGA_7260=[0.04-0.88]Another page.[2.29-3.39]Making progress.
MM_RE02_020_SAGA_7262=[0.00-2.53]Nightingale’s heart disappeared from the morgue.[3.72-4.50]Where is it now?
MM_RE02_020_WAKE_7261=[0.00-1.83]The image of the witch in the sign.[2.58-4.02]Saga addressed the witch.[4.60-6.32]The smudged line on the heart.[6.85-8.85]The second part recited from memory.[9.77-11.25]“I brought you the heart, witch.[12.17-13.52]Show me the terror.[14.35-16.65]” Saga pushed the heart through the hole in the sign.
MM_RE02_025A_CASEY_7266=[0.03-1.10]Roger that.[1.60-5.87]I followed some ATV tracks in the woods and got a bit turned around.
MM_RE02_025A_CASEY_7268=[0.03-2.67]I’ve only been lost once in my life, Anderson.[3.42-5.78]The years I spent with my ex-wife.[6.91-9.00]I’ll find my way back, don't you worry about it.
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_14294=[0.00-1.35]Bullets don’t hurt it![1.84-3.01]What is this thing?
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_14295=[0.00-2.10]Are those shadows protecting it?
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_14296=[0.00-2.20]Need to get rid of the darkness surrounding that thing.
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_16140=[0.03-1.34]Sounds like somebody’s home.
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_16141=[0.00-1.79]The text on the heart is clearer now.[2.71-3.35]Legible.
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_7263=[0.04-1.78]I need to check the general store for the heart.
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_7264=[0.00-1.51]Nightingale mentioned the general store.[2.37-3.31]I need to check it out.
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_7265=[0.00-2.72]Casey, I’m headed to the general store.[3.23-4.87]I think I know how to get into the Overlap.
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_7267=[0.05-1.25]Did you get lost?
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_7269=[0.00-0.55]Christ!
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_7271=[0.00-0.75]Fuck!
MM_RE02_025A_SAGA_7273=[0.05-0.92]A cultist.[1.32-3.26]A monster, like Nightingale.
MM_RE02_025A_TAKEN_7270=[0.13-2.25]We watch in the night!
MM_RE02_025A_TAKEN_7272=[0.03-1.97]The Cult of the Tree!
MM_RE02_025B_SAGA_7275=[0.00-1.87]And now I need to give the heart to the witch.
MM_RE02_025B_SAGA_7276=[0.03-0.99]Makes total sense.
MM_RE02_030_CASEY_7278=[0.00-1.31]Thanks for the heads up.[1.82-3.68]I’m still finding my way back.
MM_RE02_030_CASEY_7280=[1.34-5.12]Any city in America, I can get through drunk and blindfolded.[5.15-7.41]It’s these damn trees.
MM_RE02_030_CASEY_7282=[0.03-2.30]Don’t wait for me, I’ll catch up.[2.71-5.29]And be careful, Anderson.
MM_RE02_030_SAGA_12989=[0.05-0.61]Damn!
MM_RE02_030_SAGA_12990=[0.09-0.66]Shit.[1.73-2.56]Can’t talk now.
MM_RE02_030_SAGA_7277=[0.00-2.17]Casey, there are cultists in the area.[2.56-4.30]They’re Taken, like Nightingale.[5.02-6.05]Watch yourself out there.

MM_RE02_045_CASEY_7341=[0.03-1.41]We’ve reached the car, Anderson.[1.41-2.54]How’s it going down there?
MM_RE02_045_CASEY_7345=[0.91-5.86]After New York, when I started looking for our friend here, their name came up.[5.89-10.25]I pushed them for any files they had on him, but got stonewalled.

MM_RE02_045_SAGA_7339=[0.09-1.12]Should look around.[2.06-4.79]With the flooding gone, could be further clues out there.
MM_RE02_045_SAGA_7340=[0.03-2.15]The flooding disappeared very suddenly.[3.05-5.10]I wonder if there’s any connection to the Overlap.[5.80-6.68]To Nightingale.

MM_RE03_005_CASEY_4621=[0.06-1.25]No dice, pal.[1.62-6.84]This is an FBI investigation, and I don’t see a badge on that flannel.
MM_RE03_005_SAGA_16147=[0.00-1.15]Wake has more information.[2.11-3.29]I need to keep questioning him.
MM_RE03_005_SAGA_4613=[0.00-4.20]It’s insane, and there’s so much of it.
MM_RE03_005_SAGA_4614=[0.00-1.93]Wake’s hiding more manuscript pages.

MM_RE03_025_SAGA_11685=[0.00-0.92]There’s Coffee World.[1.64-2.66]Need to get across the river.
MM_RE03_025_SAGA_11686=[0.00-2.02]A coffee-themed amusement park.[3.32-4.40]Casey would never leave.

MM_RE03_030_SAGA_4629=[0.00-2.02]The keys to “my” trailer.[3.19-5.97]Now to find the Clicker, and the Cult.
MM_RE03_035A_SAGA_4631=[0.03-2.17]The page said I’d run into a cultist here.[3.45-4.45]On your toes, Saga.

MM_RE03_035B_SAGA_18629=[0.00-0.51]Divorce?[1.58-3.79]No, this never happened.

MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_11709=[0.00-1.90]There has to be a way to get this lock open.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_11712=[0.05-1.69]This is the Cult’s hideout. [3.31-4.42]Their headquarters, even?

MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_11728=[0.00-2.52]The mask is the only one without a location listed.[4.10-4.38]Hm.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_11729=[0.00-4.12]If Ilmo and Jaakko are leading the biker gang then how could they not know about the Cult.[5.21-6.52]They must be in on it.[7.84-8.82]I’ll take care of them later.

MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_11731=[0.11-0.93]Thank god.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_11732=[0.03-1.68]A “motor control circuit board”.[2.80-4.88]Christ, what a mouthful.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_11733=[0.04-3.26]I saw something, like I did in Cauldron Lake.[4.07-5.90]The well, here in Coffee World.[6.73-8.17]I know the moose skull will be there.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_11734=[0.00-0.42]It’s here.[1.43-2.17]I knew it would be.[3.57-4.55]I made them show me.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_11735=[0.00-1.51]Now I need to bring the mask to the float.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_11736=[0.00-1.29]That’s all the missing components.[1.89-3.01]I can finish the float now.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16156=[0.00-2.38]If it’s still here, I need to find it.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16157=[0.00-1.69]A creepy basement.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16158=[0.00-0.70]That’s the Clicker!
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16159=[0.00-2.56]And a parade float is the key?
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16160=[0.00-0.46]Okay.[1.72-3.53]Now where’s the parade float?
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16161=[0.00-1.95]Is this the parade float the page mentioned?
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16162=[0.00-2.78]This is one disturbing parade float.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16163=[0.03-2.33]“Stabbing again and again".[3.82-5.56]That must mean the arm is supposed to move.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16164=[0.00-4.88]Not sure what “puukko” means, but  it looks like the knife is missing.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16165=[0.03-2.23]I don’t hear any “haunting laughter".
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16166=[0.00-2.79]How come one of them is wearing a mask and the other isn’t?
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16167=[0.03-0.87]A fuse is missing.[1.44-2.88]Can’t operate the ride without it.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16168=[0.06-0.58]A fuse.[1.50-2.35]Could come in handy.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16169=[0.03-0.59]A fuse.[1.28-3.81]I can use this to get the Espresso Express working.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16170=[0.00-1.12]There’s your knife.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16171=[0.03-2.41]Some creepy laughing for atmosphere.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16172=[0.03-2.00]A little something to get those arms moving.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16173=[0.00-2.33]The moose skull goes here, obviously.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_16174=[0.00-1.87]And finally, the moose skull.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_18634=[0.00-1.50]This could be referring to the Clicker.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_18635=[0.00-1.48]This is one weird cult.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_18636=[0.00-1.60]The Cult isn’t well-organized.[2.30-3.81]People aren’t following orders.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_18637=[0.03-0.71]Rose.[2.56-4.65]She’s that waitress from the diner.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_18638=[0.03-1.78]This is the Cult’s process.[3.60-4.57]Their ritual.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_18639=[0.05-2.28]The Nightingale ritual wasn’t completed?
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_18640=[0.00-1.83]The Cult doesn’t want Wake here.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_18641=[0.00-1.06]Espresso Express.[1.56-2.00]Got it.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_18642=[0.00-0.66]Gift shop.[1.00-1.45]Easy.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_18643=[0.00-1.11]Fair Trade Fun Zone.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_18644=[0.00-1.18]Can’t make out what it says.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_4671=[0.19-2.58]This is the workshop from the photo with the cultists.[3.65-5.12]This is where they had the Clicker.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_4673=[0.03-0.60]Locked.[1.66-2.67]They must be in there.
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_4674=[0.00-0.65]Hey![1.17-1.98]Freeze!
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_4675=[0.00-0.55]No![1.24-2.22]They took it!
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_4676=[0.00-0.91]They’re playing with me.[1.50-2.87]I was so close.[3.93-4.83]They have the Clicker.[5.83-6.83]I can find them.[8.14-9.38]Where would they go?
MM_RE03_045A_SAGA_4678=[0.00-2.76]There’s an Overlap here, like there was at Cauldron Lake.[3.72-5.56]Mulligan and Thornton are like Nightingale.[6.65-7.42]Inside.[8.13-8.60]Waiting.
MM_RE03_045A_THORNTON_11715=[0.00-3.53]The darkness taking over.
MM_RE03_045A_THORNTON_11718=[0.04-5.59]We will watch it eat your mind.
MM_RE03_050A_LOGAN_11739=[0.92-2.04]Mom!
MM_RE03_050A_LOGAN_4679=[0.03-0.44]Mom![1.92-2.40]Mom![3.38-4.26]It’s cold![4.26-5.79]I’m tired!
MM_RE03_050A_SAGA_11738=[0.03-0.63]Logan?[1.36-1.83]Logan![1.83-3.63]I’m here!
MM_RE03_050A_SAGA_11740=[0.03-0.78]Logan!
MM_RE03_050A_SAGA_11741=[0.00-0.52]Wake?[2.52-3.45]What’s going on?
MM_RE03_050A_SAGA_11742=[0.03-1.88]I saw him this way in the other Overlap.
MM_RE03_050A_SAGA_4680=[0.03-2.87]What the hell?[4.27-5.21]Where am I?
MM_RE03_050A_SAGA_4681=[0.07-1.69]The story is trying to take Logan.[2.52-3.96]I can still stop this.[4.74-5.35]I need the Clicker.
MM_RE03_050A_SAGA_4682=[0.00-2.42]It’s a loop, just like before.
MM_RE03_050A_SAGA_4684=[0.00-0.94]This is a nightmare.[2.27-3.32]I can’t get through that.[4.37-5.83]I need to look for another way through.
MM_RE03_050A_SAGA_4685=[0.06-0.59]Okay.[2.22-2.88]Going down.
MM_RE03_050A_SAGA_4687=[0.00-1.11]Trapped how?[2.93-4.14]What does that mean?
MM_RE03_050A_WAKE_4683=[0.00-0.46]Anderson...[0.66-1.20]tricked...[1.85-2.67]he has it now...
MM_RE03_050A_WAKE_4686=[0.00-0.72]...still trapped...[0.87-1.40]helping me...[1.67-2.21]the hero...
MM_RE03_050B_SAGA_4692=[0.03-2.75]Wake said he could use the Clicker to undo the horror story.[4.15-6.32]I need to get back to Bright Falls, to Casey and Wake.[7.50-8.78]I should check in with Casey.
MM_RE03_050B_SAGA_4693=[0.45-1.26]Delete line
MM_RE03_055_DAVID_4696=[0.00-1.06]Hey, this is David.[1.28-2.00]Leave a message.
MM_RE03_055_SAGA_11747=[0.03-0.93]Come on, Casey.
MM_RE03_055_SAGA_11748=[0.00-1.26]This bridge got fixed quick.
MM_RE03_055_SAGA_4694=[0.00-0.61]No answer.[1.82-2.33]David.
MM_RE03_055_SAGA_4695=[0.00-1.22]Pick up, pick up, pick up.
MM_RE03_055_SAGA_4697=[0.03-2.18]David, can you call me back?[2.18-4.89]It’s urgent.[5.85-6.50]Please.
MM_RE03_055_SAGA_4698=[0.00-1.17]Why isn’t David answering?[2.27-3.30]Is Logan alright?[4.22-5.55]How does this all work?[6.45-8.11]Has the horror story already gotten her?[9.71-10.49]Wake should know.
MM_RE04_005_CASEY_5429=[0.00-1.21]Drop your weapons![1.47-2.10]Now!
MM_RE04_005_WAKE_12077=[0.03-1.20]I needed to find Casey.[1.61-3.36]We were on the same side in this fight.[3.83-4.87]Strength in numbers.
MM_RE04_005_WAKE_12078=[0.03-1.26]A gun and a flashlight.[1.81-2.83]How nostalgic.
MM_RE04_005_WAKE_12079=[0.04-2.13]These were the cultists the FBI were after.[2.65-6.58]Were they letting themselves be Taken, or did the Dark Presence not discriminate?
MM_RE04_005_WAKE_5425=[0.03-1.57]I had escaped the Dark Place.[2.10-3.34]So had the Dark Presence.[3.88-4.68]Scratch.[5.14-7.25]He was here, in Bright Falls.[7.84-10.58]I could feel him as a growing pressure in my head.[11.11-12.23]Stronger by the minute.[12.92-14.60]Why didn’t he kill me with the rest?[15.36-16.33]What did he want?
MM_RE04_005_WAKE_5426=[0.03-0.96]I gotta get out of here.
MM_RE04_005_WAKE_5428=[0.00-1.10]I need to protect myself.
MM_RE04_005_WAKE_5430=[0.03-0.75]That’s Casey.[1.20-2.27]He was still alive.
MM_RE04_010_CASEY_3795=[0.03-1.39]I am a federal agent![1.39-2.65]Surrender now!
MM_RE04_010_CASEY_5432=[0.00-2.24]I’ve had it with you cultist maniacs!
MM_RE04_010_CASEY_5433=[0.00-1.96]Give it up, you masked freaks!
MM_RE04_010_WAKE_12080=[0.03-2.00]The pressure in my head was unbearable.[2.53-3.77]Scratch was getting closer.[4.35-5.34]Stronger than ever.
MM_RE04_010_WAKE_3796=[0.00-0.90]Ugghh![1.80-2.42]Augh.[3.50-4.24]Ahh.[5.47-6.48]Ugh.
MM_RE04_010_WAKE_5436=[0.10-0.93]I’m getting closer.
MM_RE04_010_WAKE_5438=[0.05-0.55]Casey![2.48-3.16]Look out![4.02-4.75]It’s him![5.70-6.18]Scratch is-

MM_RE04_015_CASEY_3797=[0.03-2.21]What the fuck!
MM_RE04_015_CASEY_3798=[0.00-0.86]What is that?
MM_RE04_015_WAKE_12081=[0.17-1.44]The pressure eased off.[2.06-3.46]Scratch was further away.[4.09-5.07]I could think again.
MM_RE04_015_WAKE_12082=[0.04-0.52]Casey.
MM_RE04_015_WAKE_12083=[0.00-0.50]Casey![1.45-2.33]Where are you?
MM_RE04_015_WAKE_12085=[0.04-0.41]Casey![0.41-1.04]I’m coming!

MM_RE05_005_AHTI_12021=[0.74-31.97]Hmm mm hmm.
MM_RE05_005_AHTI_3476=[0.07-3.32](Kyllä, kyllä mutta) once after being told no.[3.64-5.39]Why rest, when you are born to work. (Eikö niin?)
MM_RE05_005_AHTI_3480=[0.09-1.83]Yes box, holiday.[2.23-7.66]Just thinking about it makes my dance foot waggle. (Kyllä näin on).
MM_RE05_005_CYNTHIA_12097=[0.46-1.99]Cynthia Weaver.
MM_RE05_005_CYNTHIA_12098=[0.10-0.87]Tor.[1.88-4.46]Always poking people with his hammer.
MM_RE05_005_CYNTHIA_12100=[0.91-1.57]Oh dear...[1.69-2.73]My lantern.[3.38-4.98]I think I’ve lost it.
MM_RE05_005_CYNTHIA_3468=[0.47-3.98]This will put a smile back on your face, my dear.
MM_RE05_005_CYNTHIA_3470=[0.07-4.19]In a black void, with no sense of up or down.
MM_RE05_005_NORMAN_3450=[0.00-2.58]I’m headed back to sauna with Ahti!

MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3435=[0.16-0.71]Oh![1.32-1.89]Saga![3.07-3.85]What's up?
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3439=[1.18-3.25]You say that like it’s your first time here.
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3440=[0.04-0.55]Saga![0.81-1.28]This way!
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3445=[0.03-1.57]Oh, thought I’d lost you.
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3446=[0.04-1.62]Here’s some of our residents![1.74-4.50]Or, as I like to call them, our “little Vikings”.
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3447=[0.03-1.24]Look who swung by, everyo-

MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3449=[0.00-1.36]Norman, we have a visitor.[1.65-3.11]Where are your clothes?
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3451=[2.93-4.83]Just another day in Valhalla.[5.50-7.17]I should really get back to work now, Saga.
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3452=[0.00-2.53]But feel free to spend time with Mandy-May and Norman here.[2.97-4.34]It’s good for them to have some company.
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3474=[0.20-4.26]Ahti, this is your home, you don’t need to keep cleaning.[5.62-8.28]I’d take the mop away, but I know you’ll just find it again.
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3477=[0.79-5.32]And you know Mr. Blum doesn’t like it when you take his work clothes.
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3478=[0.37-2.81]Why don’t you go pick a song from the jukebox?
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3482=[0.03-2.68]Sorry, Saga, that area is for staff only.
MM_RE05_005_ROSE_3486=[0.10-0.64]Watch out...[1.48-2.32]for puddles.[3.49-5.11]You can hurt yourself in the dark.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_12086=[0.00-1.81]Tor and Odin were in the photo with the Clicker.[2.56-3.74]They might know how it works.[5.05-7.48]I’m off the case, but I can still visit “family”.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_12087=[0.00-0.42]Hello?
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_12089=[0.07-1.75]How’d you know I was coming to see you?
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_12092=[0.03-0.81]Shit.[1.79-3.51]Something is off at that nursing home.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_12093=[0.03-2.48]Mom only ever said my grandfather was bad news.[4.04-5.83]The less I knew about him, the better.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_12094=[0.03-1.13]I shouldn’t interrupt him.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_12095=[0.00-1.32]Odin’s in bad shape.[2.81-4.08]He was drunk in Watery.[6.03-7.54]Or is this something more serious?
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_12096=[0.67-2.93]Hello, I’m Saga.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_12099=[0.12-0.91]Hi, Cynthia.[1.55-2.96]I’m looking for Tor Anderson.[3.53-4.20]Have you seen him?
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_12101=[0.20-1.82]I’ll be sure to keep an eye out for it.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_12267=[0.00-0.90]This is Tor’s room.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3433=[0.00-2.03]Tor and Odin claim to be my family.[2.97-9.32]I know Logan and I never lived here, but I don’t know enough about my family history to say they are not my relatives.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3437=[0.03-1.09]I love the architecture.[2.12-4.79]I always dreamed of living in a haunted Victorian manor.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3441=[0.00-1.67]Old Gods of Asgard.[3.38-5.63]So Odin and Tor had a band and everything.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3444=[0.03-2.15]Somebody here is Wake’s number one fan.[3.89-4.41]Rose?
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3453=[0.00-1.38]Tor and Odin are here somewhere.[2.50-3.28]Need to find them.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3454=[0.00-0.99]Phone was damaged.[1.80-3.22]While Tor was calling me?[4.33-5.97]Is someone keeping him from talking?
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3455=[0.00-0.99]This place is a mess.[1.81-2.72]And Tor is not here.[3.86-4.68]I need to keep looking.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3457=[0.03-0.98]More moonshine.[2.13-3.65]Was this a drunken rampage?
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3461=[0.00-1.79]That woman in the painting looks like Mom.[4.15-5.14]Was I born here?[6.87-8.10]Or is this more of the story?
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3463=[0.00-1.46]He’s in no shape to talk.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3465=[0.00-1.14]Don’t worry, Odin.[2.37-3.17]I’ll find him.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3469=[0.19-0.75]Sorry?
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3471=[0.03-0.81]She’s one of them.[1.98-3.58]There must be an Overlap here somewhere.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3483=[0.00-1.19]That’s where they took Tor.[1.87-2.82]Rose will have a key.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3487=[0.03-3.08]Right, uh, thanks.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_3488=[0.00-2.09]That lady is a walking red flag.
MM_RE05_005_SAGA_4105=[0.03-1.94]I should check for Tor and Odin in their rooms.
MM_RE05_005_TOR_12088=[0.00-0.45]Saga![1.00-1.78]It’s Tor![2.02-2.91]Your grandfather.[3.84-6.43]About time you were coming to visit, kiddo.
MM_RE05_005_TOR_12090=[0.00-0.85]Never mind that![1.58-2.98]We have bigger problems.[3.56-4.52]We’re losing-

MM_RE05_010_SAGA_12102=[0.00-0.65]Dark.[1.73-2.31]Empty.[3.40-4.42]Be ready, Saga.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_12103=[0.45-1.92]This door needs a knob.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_12269=[0.00-0.97]Delete line
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_18657=[0.03-2.93]Seems like Tor has been acting strangely lately.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_18658=[0.03-1.67]He had a big day in August.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_18659=[0.00-1.22]Day, then month.[2.61-4.16]He uses European formatting.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_18660=[0.03-1.59]Certain dates are circled.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_18661=[0.00-2.07]Blum was accepted into the Cult.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_3491=[0.00-0.68]Tor was here.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_3493=[0.00-4.34]He’s hurt pretty bad, but he tore off his bandages. Why?
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_3494=[0.03-1.13]Abigail Barrows.[2.74-3.30]A Taken?
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_3496=[0.03-1.02]Tor, wait![1.83-2.61]It’s me!
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_3497=[0.03-1.15]Come on!
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_3498=[0.00-1.01]An electric lock.[1.77-3.62]Looks like it’s controlled remotely.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_3500=[0.03-1.23]A security computer.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_3501=[0.00-0.90]Needs a password.[1.84-6.65]And a warrant, technically, but, hey, desperate times.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_3502=[0.03-3.96]The Koskela brothers aren’t just in the Cult, they’re its damn leaders.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_3505=[0.00-1.23]And the doors are open.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_3506=[0.00-0.51]There’s Tor.[0.51-2.53]And he’s out of his mind.[3.87-4.69]Need to get to him.
MM_RE05_010_SAGA_4112=[0.05-0.72]Hello?[2.42-3.03]Tor?[5.42-6.95]It's Saga Anderson.
MM_RE05_010_TOR_12268=[0.03-1.45]Cynthia, baby![1.78-2.58]Hold up!
MM_RE05_015_CYNTHIA_3519=[0.37-1.91]He had it coming!
MM_RE05_015_SAGA_12104=[0.00-1.07]Need to catch up with Tor.
MM_RE05_015_SAGA_3510=[0.23-0.45]Shit!
MM_RE05_015_SAGA_3517=[0.03-1.53]Jesus Christ.
MM_RE05_015_SAGA_4114=[0.00-1.03]This must have been Tor’s.
MM_RE05_025_SAGA_3527=[0.04-0.54]Tor?
MM_RE05_025_SAGA_3528=[0.00-0.88]There is an Overlap here.[1.68-3.01]Did Cynthia pull Tor in?
MM_RE05_025_SAGA_3529=[0.03-1.34]She’s clearly lying to me.[2.33-2.75]Why?
MM_RE05_025_SAGA_3530=[0.00-1.43]The horror story beat me to Tor.[2.81-3.80]I have to rescue him.[5.55-8.40]The key to this Overlap is an Old Gods of Asgard record.[9.27-10.12]Odin will know more.
MM_RE05_030_NORMAN_3531=[0.00-0.87]Hey, Saga![0.97-3.58]Welcome to the emergency muster point.
MM_RE05_030_ODIN_3532=[0.00-7.55]Hhrrr...
MM_RE05_030_ODIN_3533=[0.00-5.32]Aah! 
MM_RE05_030_ODIN_3534=[0.00-1.04]Saga...
MM_RE05_030_ODIN_3535=[0.00-1.36]No! 
MM_RE05_030_ODIN_3536=[0.00-0.51]Help!
MM_RE05_030_ODIN_3537=[0.04-9.97]Hhhhrrrrr...
MM_RE05_030_ODIN_3539=[0.00-0.93]Saga?
MM_RE05_030_SAGA_3538=[0.00-1.30]This isn’t “Anger’s Remorse”.
MM_RE05_030_SAGA_3540=[0.00-0.79]Rest up, Odin.[1.75-4.31]I’ll find the record, and I’ll find Tor.
MM_RE05_035_AHTI_3546=[0.28-3.66]Getting in is forbidden, for your own safety.[5.41-8.23]Time is long for those who wait.[9.06-12.17]But in the end, stand the thanks.
MM_RE05_035_AHTI_3550=[0.00-3.37]No use crying in the dark place.[3.81-5.39]What has been, has gone.[6.63-9.18]But trouble doesn’t look like this![10.57-14.86]You can go to the basement and check the generator.[15.63-20.46]But look out - you can never know in which tree the devil sits.
MM_RE05_035_SAGA_12270=[0.03-1.16]Cynthia has the record.[2.10-3.68]She will tell me where to find it.
MM_RE05_035_SAGA_12271=[0.03-2.39]Cynthia took the record and I brought it back.
MM_RE05_035_SAGA_12272=[0.00-0.69]Sheesh.[1.03-1.88]Didn’t see you there.
MM_RE05_035_SAGA_3542=[0.03-0.82]“Anger’s Remorse”.[1.92-2.60]This is the one.[4.09-4.80]But it’s gone.
MM_RE05_035_SAGA_3548=[0.00-0.95]God damn lights.
MM_RE05_035_SAGA_3549=[0.00-0.59]The basement.[1.24-1.69]Thanks.
MM_RE05_035_SAGA_3551=[0.00-1.48]Key fob’s no good without power.
MM_RE05_045_SAGA_3556=[0.03-1.19]I need to get the power back on.
MM_RE05_045_SAGA_3557=[0.03-0.81]Fuse is blown.[2.32-3.64]Maybe there are spares nearby.
MM_RE05_045_SAGA_3558=[0.00-2.14]Thomas Zane looked just like Wake.[3.87-5.79]Is this why Odin keeps calling him Tom?
MM_RE05_045_SAGA_3559=[0.00-0.34]There.[1.38-2.30]Power’s back on.
MM_RE05_045_SAGA_4118=[0.03-0.62]Shit.
MM_RE05_050_SAGA_4119=[0.03-1.86]What the fuck is this?
MM_RE05_050_SAGA_4120=[0.00-2.49]Nothing good ever happens in basements.
MM_RE05_055A_SAGA_18662=[0.00-1.29]Tor’s a romantic, huh?
MM_RE05_055A_SAGA_18663=[0.00-4.17]The Dark Presence uses people’s memories, their fears, to corrupt them.
MM_RE05_055A_SAGA_18664=[0.00-3.64]I’m guessing the woman in this photograph was not Cynthia’s favorite.
MM_RE05_055A_SAGA_18665=[0.03-1.12]A power station?[3.11-4.54]Everyone needs a hobby I guess.
MM_RE05_055A_SAGA_18666=[0.03-0.49]A dam?[1.46-3.36]Was Cynthia into civil engineering?
MM_RE05_055A_SAGA_18667=[0.03-2.38]I feel like I’m missing some context here.
MM_RE05_055A_SAGA_3560=[0.03-0.60]A lantern.[2.77-4.48]Was Cynthia using it for protection?[6.27-8.00]Did she know about the Dark Presence?
MM_RE05_055B_CYNTHIA_3565=[0.35-3.07]The dark water pressed itself into her.
MM_RE05_060_SAGA_3566=[0.00-1.50]The song will show me the way.
MM_RE05_065_SAGA_3567=[0.03-1.29]The Overlap is at the pond.
MM_RE05_065_SAGA_3568=[0.00-0.81]Fuck.[1.71-2.55]Here we go again.
MM_RE05_070_LOGAN_3569=[0.10-0.50]Mom![0.50-3.88]What are you doing?[3.91-4.75]Help me![4.78-5.68]Please!
MM_RE05_070_LOGAN_3570=[0.05-1.21]Mom![2.14-3.28]Help me![4.83-6.45]I can’t-
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12273=[0.03-1.53]I feel like I’ve been here before.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12274=[0.14-0.92]I think I’m lost.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12275=[0.00-1.45]This doesn’t feel like the right way.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12276=[0.00-1.21]Did I get turned around?
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12277=[0.03-1.12]Am I going in circles?
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12278=[0.03-0.80]The power’s off.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12279=[0.03-1.82]I need to get the power on to use the switch.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12280=[0.00-0.57]No power.[1.65-2.59]Can’t use the switch.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12281=[0.03-0.91]Something changed.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12282=[0.00-0.93]The door is open now.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12283=[0.00-1.16]That door wasn’t there before.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12284=[0.03-2.39]Stop, you fucking monster!
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_12285=[0.00-0.74]A dead end.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_18668=[0.00-1.18]I’m back where I was.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_3571=[0.05-1.18]This isn’t real!
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_3572=[0.22-1.28]Fuck this place.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_3574=[0.00-0.82]It’s a loop.[1.06-1.80]Like the others.[3.34-4.37]I need to reach the center.
MM_RE05_070_SAGA_3576=[0.03-0.67]Back again.[1.65-2.38]Gotta go deeper.
MM_RE05_070_WAKE_3573=[0.03-0.64]...closer now...[0.81-1.39]destroyed...[1.69-2.45]the only way...
MM_RE05_070_WAKE_3575=[0.00-1.02]...writing a story...
MM_RE05_075_CYNTHIA_24168=[0.23-3.09]Drowned beneath dark water.
MM_RE05_075_SAGA_12288=[0.03-0.50]Tor![0.50-1.15]I’m here![2.10-2.98]I’m coming!
MM_RE05_075_SAGA_12290=[0.00-1.58]I need to get the lights on to reach him.
MM_RE05_075_SAGA_12292=[0.11-1.51]I’m not leaving you here, Tor.[2.63-3.37]Hold on!
MM_RE05_075_SAGA_12294=[0.00-1.91]You can apologize to him yourself.[3.23-4.72]I’m getting you the hell out of here.
MM_RE05_075_SAGA_3577=[0.00-0.55]Tor!
MM_RE05_075_SAGA_3578=[0.00-0.90]You took Tor.[2.21-3.48]I’m here to take him back.
MM_RE05_075_TOR_12286=[0.23-1.14]Cynthia?[1.86-2.87]Baby?[2.90-7.42]It was fun for awhile, but can we stop now?
MM_RE05_075_TOR_12287=[0.19-0.86]Saga![1.43-2.56]Where are you?[3.51-4.39]Can you hear me?[5.43-6.82]It’s so dark.[8.71-9.96]I’m sorry, kiddo.[10.49-11.80]The hag tricked me.
MM_RE05_075_TOR_12289=[0.11-0.83]Saga.[1.69-4.38]It’s so damn dark down here.[5.42-6.39]I’m underwater.[7.65-9.82]She’s trapped me at the bottom.[11.23-12.93]I don’t think I’m gonna make it.
MM_RE05_075_TOR_12291=[0.07-1.37]I can’t fight her.[2.51-3.95]I’m done for.[4.73-6.21]Get out of here, kiddo.
MM_RE05_075_TOR_12293=[0.20-1.18]It’s cold.[2.18-2.75]Dark.[3.87-6.36]I can’t see a god damn thing.[9.01-13.53]Tell Odin I’m sorry I fucked everything up.
MM_RE05_080_SAGA_3595=[0.00-1.21]Thanks for telling me this, Tor.[2.57-3.69]I need to go find Wake.[4.51-5.32]To stop this.
MM_RE05_080_SAGA_3597=[0.13-1.19]I needed to hear that.[3.34-4.31]Thanks, grandpa.
MM_RE05_080_SAGA_4122=[0.04-0.90]We need to talk.
MM_RE05_080_SAGA_4124=[0.10-1.34]How do you know about that?
MM_RE05_080_TOR_12296=[0.08-4.39]Remember, your daughter is alive.[5.87-9.48]Just kept from you by this bullshit horror story.
MM_RE05_080_TOR_3596=[0.04-3.53]The Old Gods of Asgard will be ready to help.[4.88-8.54]Me and my bro will bring the rock when you need it.
MM_RE05_080_TOR_3598=[0.00-2.72]Don’t worry about me, kiddo.[3.79-6.68]I’ll drag my sorry ass over to Odin.[7.52-11.99]A few shots of the Anderson’s finest will fix us both up.[13.24-14.88]See you soon, Saga.
MM_RE05_080_TOR_4123=[1.35-2.11]Damn right.[3.21-4.72]Lots for me to explain.[6.06-7.08]But not here.[7.95-9.80]The night’s got ears.[10.55-12.98]We can have our talk in your head.[14.08-15.88]You have a room there, right?
MM_RE05_080_TOR_4125=[0.36-2.16]I’m your grandfather![3.30-4.63]What don’t I know?
MM_RE06_005_ESTEVEZ_12336=[0.78-1.29]I’m here.[1.67-2.30]In the closet.
MM_RE06_005_ESTEVEZ_12338=[0.03-0.72]Anderson?[2.36-3.61]Didn’t I tell you to fuck off?
MM_RE06_005_ESTEVEZ_12340=[0.30-0.88]Looks like.[1.32-4.07]Listen, my leg is busted so I need your help.[4.92-9.11]There’s a person out there with you, invaded by something we call the Shadow and-
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12327=[0.00-2.38]The FBC is holding Wake at the Sheriff’s Station.[3.62-5.65]I need to make Agent Estevez understand.[6.48-8.19]They have Wake and I have the Clicker.[8.91-10.68]We have to work together to stop this.
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12328=[0.06-0.59]Casey?[1.46-2.58]Do you read me, Casey?
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12329=[0.00-0.65]Damn it.[1.66-3.12]Where are you, Casey?
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12330=[0.00-1.24]He better be okay.[2.73-3.60]Focus, Saga.[4.11-6.12]Get to the station, to Wake.
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12331=[0.00-1.54]The agents watching the door are gone.
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12332=[0.00-1.03]Power’s out.[2.14-3.07]Always a good sign.
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12333=[0.00-1.18]There’s Taken inside.
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12334=[0.00-0.78]“Holding cells”.[1.99-3.29]Is that where they are keeping Wake?[5.15-6.12]Door’s locked though.
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12335=[0.00-0.83]Anyone here?
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12337=[0.03-1.14]Agent Estevez?[2.00-2.73]Is that you?
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12339=[0.03-1.65]Looks like it’s a good thing I didn’t.
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12341=[0.03-0.67]A Taken.[1.60-3.08]Yeah, I’ll handle it.
MM_RE06_005_SAGA_12342=[0.03-1.30]All clear, Estevez!
MM_RE06_010_ESTEVEZ_12344=[0.06-1.92]It feels even worse.[3.16-4.77]But thanks for saving the rest of me.[7.00-8.31]We should talk.
MM_RE06_010_SAGA_12343=[0.03-1.51]That leg doesn’t look good.
MM_RE06_010_SAGA_18669=[0.00-2.22]An electrical lock system with no failsafe.[3.25-3.91]Smart.
MM_RE06_015_CASEY_12350=[0.00-1.51]Stay the fuck down!
MM_RE06_015_CASEY_12352=[0.00-0.75]Anderson?
MM_RE06_015_CASEY_12354=[0.45-1.30]Hey Anderson.[2.01-3.28]Like what I’ve done with the place?
MM_RE06_015_CASEY_12356=[1.52-2.26]Funny.
MM_RE06_015_CASEY_12358=[0.00-1.48]I’m not going anywhere.
MM_RE06_015_ESTEVEZ_12345=[0.00-1.01]Do you read me, Anderson?
MM_RE06_015_ESTEVEZ_12347=[0.00-1.67]Eavesdropping is a big part of the job.[2.70-4.51]But no, I got it from your partner.
MM_RE06_015_ESTEVEZ_12348=[0.00-3.52]Anderson - look for a fuse to replace the blown out one in the fusebox.[3.77-5.11]That should get the power going again.
MM_RE06_015_SAGA_12346=[0.03-0.71]I read you.[2.41-4.56]Have you had our frequency this entire time?
MM_RE06_015_SAGA_12349=[0.00-1.52]Yep, on it.
MM_RE06_015_SAGA_12351=[0.36-0.70]Casey?[1.19-2.08]Is that you?
MM_RE06_015_SAGA_12353=[0.00-1.06]Hold your fire![1.84-2.71]I’m coming in.
MM_RE06_015_SAGA_12355=[0.00-0.69]Mm.[1.63-3.57]Could use a bit morgue light.
MM_RE06_015_SAGA_12357=[0.03-1.04]Stay put, Casey.[1.73-2.98]I’ll let you know when it’s safe.
MM_RE06_020_ESTEVEZ_12359=[0.00-0.53]Anderson.[1.05-2.25]Good news, bad news.[2.73-7.20]You can get to the cell block now, but the Shaded hostiles that were in there are on the loose.
MM_RE06_020_ESTEVEZ_12361=[0.03-0.89]More coming down!
MM_RE06_020_ESTEVEZ_12363=[0.00-0.31]Copy.
MM_RE06_020_SAGA_12360=[0.00-0.78]Thanks for the heads-up.
MM_RE06_020_SAGA_12362=[0.00-1.75]Situation is under control, Estevez.[2.63-3.45]Coming back up.
MM_RE06_020_SAGA_18670=[0.03-1.66]Something is happening to Casey.
MM_RE06_025_ESTEVEZ_12364=[0.00-1.49]Anderson, over here.
MM_RE06_025_ESTEVEZ_12365=[0.00-0.93]Behind the counter.
MM_RE06_025_ESTEVEZ_12366=[0.00-1.30]Got a little cramped in that closet.
MM_RE06_025_ESTEVEZ_12368=[0.03-4.65]According to the Luck and Probability Department, it’s statistically bad luck to wish people good luck during a crisis.
MM_RE06_025_ILMO_12370=[0.05-0.74]Saga![1.60-6.00]Fucking FBI, FBC, you government fucks all fucking this up for us![6.66-7.68]Let us the fuck out!

MM_RE06_025_SAGA_12369=[0.00-0.51]Thanks.
MM_RE06_025_SAGA_12371=[0.00-1.53]You’re the leaders of the Cult.[2.20-3.41]You aren’t going anywhere.
MM_RE06_025_WAKE_12372=[0.54-1.27]Saga.[1.68-4.25]Do you have it?
MM_RE06_030_ESTEVEZ_12387=[0.00-2.37]Bad news: the containment unit isn’t prepped.[2.42-3.97]But the light array should affect him.
MM_RE06_030_ESTEVEZ_12389=[0.03-4.08]I can turn them on from here, but you need to prime the three Power Cores first.[4.19-5.95]The glowing FBC generator cubes.
MM_RE06_030_ESTEVEZ_12391=[0.36-1.82]Two more to go.
MM_RE06_030_ESTEVEZ_12393=[0.03-0.96]Only one left.[0.96-1.48]Doing great.
MM_RE06_030_ESTEVEZ_12396=[0.00-0.78]All green.[0.97-1.57]Cover your eyes.
MM_RE06_030_ESTEVEZ_12397=[0.06-0.41]Great.[1.40-3.29]Now get him in front of the lights and I’ll trigger them.
MM_RE06_030_ESTEVEZ_12398=[0.03-2.10]I can’t hit the lights until he’s right in front of them, Anderson.
MM_RE06_030_ESTEVEZ_12399=[0.00-1.90]Get him in front of the lights, Anderson.
MM_RE06_030_ESTEVEZ_13024=[0.03-3.92]I can turn them on from here, but you need to prime the two Power Cores first.[4.11-6.33]The glowing FBC generator cubes.
MM_RE06_030_ILMO_12381=[0.03-0.88]My brother.
MM_RE06_030_ILMO_12382=[0.00-0.67]Jaakko.
MM_RE06_030_ILMO_12383=[0.00-2.59]Oh fuck, Jaakko.[2.59-2.88]Fuck.
MM_RE06_030_SAGA_12384=[0.04-2.84]Shit shit shit shit.
MM_RE06_030_SAGA_12385=[0.00-0.71]It’s Scratch.[1.69-3.00]He was pretending to be Wake.[3.87-5.39]The plan is fucked.
MM_RE06_030_SAGA_12386=[0.03-1.28]Estevez, come in![1.51-2.67]Scratch is here.[2.91-4.02]How do I stop him?
MM_RE06_030_SAGA_12388=[0.00-0.76]I found the lights![1.38-2.37]How do I activate them?
MM_RE06_030_SAGA_12390=[0.00-0.50]Got one.
MM_RE06_030_SAGA_12392=[0.03-1.32]Another core activated.
MM_RE06_030_SAGA_12394=[0.00-0.78]That’s all of them.
MM_RE06_030_SAGA_12395=[0.00-0.66]Hit it.
MM_RE06_030_SAGA_12400=[0.03-1.78]I need to lure Scratch in front of the lights.
MM_RE06_030_SAGA_13022=[0.07-1.19]Fuck.
MM_RE06_030_SAGA_13023=[0.00-1.30]Okay, lights.[2.60-3.12]Got it.
MM_RE06_035_CASEY_12405=[0.00-1.22]You said it, Anderson.[1.97-3.12]It’s a shit show.[4.49-6.15]So what’s the plan?
MM_RE06_035_ESTEVEZ_12404=[0.00-1.63]Textbook boondoggle.
MM_RE06_035_ODIN_12411=[0.12-3.10]Yeah!
MM_RE06_035_ODIN_12413=[0.03-2.42]The coconut song!
MM_RE06_035_SAGA_12403=[0.03-1.34]Scratch is Wake’s double.[1.79-2.50]He tricked us.[3.35-4.67]He almost got the Clicker from me.[5.51-7.54]The whole plan’s gone out the window.[8.94-10.66]How did we get this so wrong?
MM_RE06_035_SAGA_12406=[0.03-0.78]I’ve got it now.[1.50-4.29]I just need to tell the others what to do and fix everything.[5.10-5.62]For good.
MM_RE06_035_SAGA_12407=[0.03-0.38]Tor?[1.38-3.09]I need the Old Gods of Asgard.[3.94-5.34]I need a very special song.
MM_RE06_035_SAGA_12409=[1.30-2.49]You saw this coming, huh.[3.35-4.11]Of course.[5.73-9.71]I need a song about Alan Wake, about bringing him out of the Dark Place.
MM_RE06_035_SAGA_12415=[0.03-1.42]I hope they’ve still got it.
MM_RE06_035_SAGA_18671=[0.00-3.38]Wake isn’t the first person the Dark Presence disguised itself as.
MM_RE06_035_SAGA_18672=[0.00-2.80]What the hell is a “parautilitarian”?
MM_RE06_035_SAGA_18673=[0.00-1.40]The Cult didn’t trust Wake.[2.67-3.82]Or is it Scratch?
MM_RE06_035_SAGA_18674=[0.03-2.45]The lake is a gateway to the Dark Place.
MM_RE06_035_TOR_12408=[0.07-1.07]Hell yeah![1.95-7.32]The tour bus is already loaded and we’ve said our goodbyes![7.85-12.47]Ready to hit the road, just like old times, baby!
MM_RE06_035_TOR_12410=[0.08-5.19]A writer, a lake of darkness, bringing him into the light.[5.82-7.83]It writes itself!
MM_RE06_035_TOR_12412=[0.03-1.79]We’ll see you at Cauldron Lake.[2.43-4.87]Last one there is a fucking coconut!
MM_RE06_035_TOR_12414=[0.00-2.73]Not that again, you old fool![3.26-5.17]Let’s get this show on the road!
MM_RE07_010_CASEY_13223=[0.00-2.62]The lights and the containment cell are good to go, Anderson.
MM_RE07_010_CASEY_13225=[0.00-1.97]The two golden oldies?[2.34-5.11]They’re here, and they brought moonshine.[5.58-7.58]I love them already .
MM_RE07_010_ESTEVEZ_13210=[0.03-2.05]We’re incoming with the lights, Anderson.[2.05-2.86]Where do you want ‘em?
MM_RE07_010_ESTEVEZ_13212=[0.00-0.77]We’ll be ready.[1.40-2.20]Estevez out.
MM_RE07_010_ESTEVEZ_13226=[0.00-1.16]They’re a lot.
MM_RE07_010_ODIN_13214=[0.04-2.34]I’m driving with one hand!
MM_RE07_010_ODIN_13218=[0.07-0.76]What tree?[0.76-3.50]There’s no tree in the song!
MM_RE07_010_ODIN_13219=[0.00-3.55]Who the fuck puts a tree in the middle of the road?
MM_RE07_010_SAGA_13211=[0.00-1.08]Set them up on the shore.[1.34-2.98]We need to be ready if Scratch shows up.
MM_RE07_010_SAGA_13215=[0.00-1.59]I need you to meet me at the shore.[2.82-3.68]Is the song ready?
MM_RE07_010_SAGA_13221=[0.00-1.46]Drive carefully, grandpa!
MM_RE07_010_SAGA_13222=[0.00-1.85]Very rock and roll way to drive.
MM_RE07_010_SAGA_13224=[0.00-0.51]Great.[0.67-1.86]Are Tor and Odin there yet?
MM_RE07_010_SAGA_13227=[0.00-3.17]You wanted to know what art we would use, well, that’s them.[4.66-5.38]I’ll be there soon.
MM_RE07_010_TOR_13213=[0.10-0.75]Kiddo![1.23-2.65]We’re almost at the gig![3.05-6.87]And Odin’s run over four minions of darkness![7.33-10.76]The bus is our hammer!
MM_RE07_010_TOR_13216=[0.03-0.87]Almost![1.27-3.86]Odin’s got a killer chorus![4.46-12.60]“Come save your soul, awake new and whole, by name I will summon him.[13.12-21.10]It’s a dark ocean summoning.
MM_RE07_010_TOR_13217=[0.05-0.92]Bro, tree![1.06-1.83]Tree!
MM_RE07_010_TOR_13220=[0.07-2.11]We’re not on a road!
MM_RE07_015_CASEY_13236=[0.03-1.87]The show’s drawing a crowd!
MM_RE07_015_CASEY_13239=[0.06-1.91]The Taken are going for the old guys.
MM_RE07_015_CASEY_13240=[0.00-2.21]Fucking hell![3.00-4.13]Yes!
MM_RE07_015_ESTEVEZ_13235=[0.03-2.97]A whole lot of paranatural crimes happening right now.[4.23-5.46]But it’s fucking awesome![5.66-6.55]I want a t-shirt!
MM_RE07_015_ESTEVEZ_13237=[0.00-1.16]Taken incoming, Anderson!
MM_RE07_015_ESTEVEZ_13238=[0.00-1.75]Anderson, they are trying to stop the song.
MM_RE07_015_ESTEVEZ_13241=[0.59-2.91]The power of rock and roll.
MM_RE07_015_ODIN_13230=[0.00-1.91]Hello, Cauldron Lake![2.24-5.68]Great to see so many federal agents here tonight!
MM_RE07_015_ODIN_13232=[0.00-4.10]This song goes out to our favorite tortured writer.[4.87-9.74]Let these sweet tunes guide you out of the darkness![10.11-14.81]It’s called “Dark Ocean Summoning”!
MM_RE07_015_ODIN_13233=[0.00-1.96]Aaaaaa- kaff kaff.[8.82-11.03]Let’s try that again.
MM_RE07_015_SAGA_13228=[0.26-1.68]Hey, I’m here.[2.45-2.91]I’m here.[2.91-3.85]Let’s get ready.
MM_RE07_015_SAGA_13229=[0.00-2.88]Grandpa, you signal me when the song is done-[3.08-4.84]and I’ll use the Clicker to bring Wake back.[5.65-6.46]Hit it!
MM_RE07_015_SAGA_13242=[0.03-0.56]There![1.12-2.32]A connection to the Dark Place.[3.07-4.00]Like the Overlaps.[4.77-6.16]That’s the place to use the Clicker.
MM_RE07_015_SAGA_13246=[0.03-1.74]I need to go to the opening to use the Clicker.
MM_RE07_015_SAGA_13247=[0.03-0.73]Everything’s ready.[1.46-2.38]I need to use the Clicker.
MM_RE07_015_SAGA_13248=[0.00-2.41]Time to use the Clicker and bring Wake back.
MM_RE07_015_TOR_13231=[0.00-8.12]Prepare to experience a soul-searing, mind-frying, act of black magic and sorcery!
MM_RE07_015_TOR_13234=[4.76-7.60]You’re making me look bad in front of Saga, bro.
MM_RE07_015_TOR_13243=[0.00-2.06]The stage is yours, kiddo![2.42-3.88]Flick the switch!
MM_RE07_015_TOR_13244=[0.00-1.92]Now is the time, Saga![2.29-4.27]Use the Clicker!
MM_RE07_015_TOR_13245=[0.00-1.27]Use the Clicker now![1.44-2.91]Make it come true!
MM_RE07_020_ESTEVEZ_13257=[0.00-1.67]I’m routing all the power to the lights.[2.00-3.30]The cell’s going to go dark now.[3.30-5.09]It’s not safe for you anymore.
MM_RE07_020_ESTEVEZ_13260=[0.03-1.17]I’ll try to trap him with the light.[1.17-2.99]Buy you time to turn the lights to face the cell.
MM_RE07_020_ESTEVEZ_13261=[0.00-0.97]He is too fast.[1.30-3.80]Anderson, pin him down with gunfire for me to get the light on him.
MM_RE07_020_ESTEVEZ_13263=[0.15-1.23]Got him![1.42-2.05]He’s trapped![2.13-3.22]This is your shot, Anderson.[3.22-3.93]Turn the lights!
MM_RE07_020_SAGA_13258=[0.00-0.98]I can live with that.[1.94-2.36]I hope.
MM_RE07_020_SAGA_13262=[0.00-0.61]On it.
MM_RE07_020_SAGA_13264=[0.03-2.34]I need to turn all the lights to point at the cell.
MM_RE07_020_SAGA_13265=[0.00-0.54]That’s one.[1.54-3.74]Need to get the other one pointed toward the cell as well.
MM_RE07_020_SAGA_13266=[0.00-1.50]Now I need to get him in the cell.
MM_RE07_020_SCRATCH_13259=[0.06-3.08]The end of the story.
MM_RE07_020_SCRATCH_13267=[0.08-0.92]The Clicker!
MM_RE07_025_ESTEVEZ_13281=[0.00-0.33]Hey![0.42-1.00]Over here!
MM_RE07_025_ESTEVEZ_13282=[0.03-0.46]Wake?[0.46-1.40]We need to talk!
MM_RE07_025_ESTEVEZ_13283=[0.00-1.03]You need to come to me.[1.65-4.02]I’m done trying to move with this leg.
MM_RE07_025_ESTEVEZ_13284=[0.00-1.21]Welcome back, Wake.[2.68-3.82]You are Wake now, right?[3.82-4.87]With the Shadow out of you?[6.52-7.66]Some good news, at least.[9.06-14.47]Bad news is I haven’t seen a situation this fucked since the AWE in Eagle River.
MM_RE07_025_ESTEVEZ_13285=[0.00-1.20]The Shadow is now in Alex.[1.20-2.71]And Anderson is gone.[3.47-5.66]We need to figure out how to salvage this.
MM_RE07_025_ODIN_13279=[0.00-0.57]Tom![1.55-3.78]We need to head to our next gig.[4.49-7.97]We’re doing this for you and our lovely Saga.[8.83-11.68]You take care of things on this side!
MM_RE07_025_TOR_13280=[0.00-1.77]Don’t screw it up, Tom!
MM_RE07_025_WAKE_13278=[0.00-4.06]I’d seen it all play out, like a horror movie I’d been forced to watch.[4.74-6.68]The Dark Presence held all the cards now.
MM_RE07_025_WAKE_13286=[0.03-0.83]I needed a car.[1.49-3.70]The FBI vehicle would be at the parking lot.
MM_RE07_025_WAKE_13287=[0.00-1.02]I was awake again.[1.46-4.71]Clear-headed for the first time in what felt like a lifetime.[5.66-7.59]I was back exactly where I left.[7.75-10.33]In a dark forest outside Bright Falls.[10.84-11.86]A gun in one hand.[12.20-13.37]A flashlight in the other.[14.06-15.32]Haunted by my own writing.[15.90-17.00]Alice taken from me.[17.87-19.13]I knew what I had to do.[19.82-22.02]Stop the horror story from coming true.[22.72-24.02]Stop the Dark Presence.
MM_RE07_025_WAKE_13288=[0.00-2.95]In the Dark Place, the Dark Presence went into me.[3.86-5.07]When I was pulled back here.[5.07-6.45]Crossing over weakened it.[6.92-7.77]Made it dormant.[8.50-10.00]I couldn’t remember what had happened.[10.80-13.09]But I could feel it getting stronger.[13.62-14.37]Waking up.[15.25-17.32]I thought it was hunting me, closing in.[17.95-19.77]It was inside me the whole time.[19.77-20.89]And then it took over.[21.95-23.04]Turned me into Scratch.
MM_RE07_025_WAKE_13289=[0.03-1.39]I had to get to Bright Falls.[2.13-3.43]See this through to the end.
MM_RE08_005_WAKE_12586=[0.09-2.53]Everyone and everything revolved around “Return”.[3.02-4.52]As if it had just been published.
MM_RE08_005_WAKE_5089=[0.04-1.01]This is...[1.64-3.13]not what I expected.
MM_RE08_005_WAKE_5093=[0.18-2.15]I was inside Scratch’s ending.[2.64-4.49]A perverse version of reality.[4.89-6.34]The townspeople brainwashed.
MM_RE08_005_WAKE_5094=[0.31-2.11]I needed to get a copy of “Return”.[2.48-5.18]I needed to read the ending to have a shot at changing it.
MM_RE08_010A_ILMO_12587=[0.00-2.25]And the best is yet to come![2.44-4.90]Our big giveaway is almost here![5.08-14.54]There’s still time to get a photo with the last remaining copy of Wake’s gorgeous-looking novel “Return”, which we’ll be raffling off later tonight!
MM_RE08_010A_ILMO_5096=[0.03-2.84]Dear friends, I know what you’re all saying.[2.84-6.71]That this is the best Deerfest we’ve ever had![6.86-13.78]I wish I could take credit, but that all goes to Bright Falls’ very own Alan Wake!
MM_RE08_010A_WAKE_5097=[0.03-1.94]I had to get the last copy of the book.
MM_RE08_010B_WAKE_12588=[0.04-1.22]I could get out through the back.
MM_RE08_015_ALICE_12591=[0.03-0.50]Alan...
MM_RE08_015_ALICE_12594=[0.03-0.45]Alan...
MM_RE08_015_ALICE_14005=Alan...
MM_RE08_015_ROSE_5114=[0.38-1.97]Get your butt in gear, Alan![2.27-3.41]It’s safe here!
MM_RE08_015_SCRATCH_5112=[0.00-2.04]You are home!
MM_RE08_015_WAKE_12589=[0.00-4.78]Was Scratch’s insecure need for fame, for praise, drawn from my psyche?[5.78-9.02]I would bring his sick fantasy crashing down around him.
MM_RE08_015_WAKE_12590=[0.03-1.80]I had to find another way inside.
MM_RE08_015_WAKE_12592=[0.06-0.51]Alice?
MM_RE08_015_WAKE_12593=[0.00-0.83]What was that?[1.65-2.62]Alice was dead.[3.27-6.14]Was this a trap, or Scratch torturing me?
MM_RE08_015_WAKE_12595=[0.03-0.56]Shit![0.74-1.25]Scratch!
MM_RE08_015_WAKE_12596=[0.00-0.95]Fuck off!
MM_RE08_015_WAKE_12597=[0.05-1.41]Shut the fuck up!
MM_RE08_015_WAKE_12598=[0.00-0.81]Fuck!
MM_RE08_015_WAKE_5107=[0.03-1.75]I needed to reach the Writer’s Room.[2.32-3.43]Write a new conclusion.
MM_RE08_020_AHTI_12035=[0.00-3.57]Now there’s a devil in the fish trap.
MM_RE08_020_AHTI_14054=[0.03-4.34]All you need is water and Vileda.[5.52-7.83]Water is the oldest balm.[8.93-10.84]Water finds its way.[12.43-15.93]What water brings, it takes away.[17.19-21.94]It can be clean or dirty, it can give life or drown it.
MM_RE08_020_AHTI_14055=[0.07-5.50]Don’t be spooked by it so that shit won’t start beating your underpants.[7.66-11.87]Okay, I’ll get the door open for you, Tom.
MM_RE08_020_AHTI_5124=[0.00-2.54]We loop around, and come together, Tom.[4.07-7.84]I have put everything ready for the visitors.[9.53-12.25]I’ll come to wash the floor of your room next.
MM_RE08_020_AHTI_5125=[0.07-1.77]There you go.[3.10-5.12]The matter is a steak.[7.70-10.75]Now comes the end of the rhyme.
MM_RE08_020_ROSE_49548=(sigh)
MM_RE08_020_ROSE_5115=[0.00-1.18]We’re safe in the light, Alan.[2.17-2.76]For now.[3.84-5.45]But he’s very pushy.
MM_RE08_020_ROSE_5117=[0.00-3.45]I’m here to save you, silly.[4.73-5.68]I got your instructions.[6.13-8.59]I found every hidden message you left for me.[9.16-9.77]In the radio.[10.07-10.62]In the wind.[10.88-12.86]In the forums on my Alan Wake fansite.
MM_RE08_020_ROSE_5118=[1.02-2.80]Oh, I get it![3.45-8.58]Yes, Alan, only a crazy person would think you’ve been leaving them secret messages.[10.00-10.63]Wink.
MM_RE08_020_ROSE_5121=[0.08-2.40]But now you need to get your butt upstairs, Alan.[2.96-6.82]This shit won’t write itself, no matter what William Shakespeare said.
MM_RE08_020_WAKE_12599=[0.03-0.86]Upstairs.[1.50-3.37]The Writer’s Room must be in the attic.[4.34-5.50]That’s where the windows were.
MM_RE08_020_WAKE_12600=[0.00-0.50]Ahti.[1.86-3.26]I didn’t expect to see you here.[3.26-4.17]But it makes sense.[6.01-9.05]Can you help me find my way, one last time?
MM_RE08_020_WAKE_5116=[0.00-1.06]Rose, right?[1.79-2.52]From the diner?[3.44-4.31]How are you here?
MM_RE08_020_WAKE_5120=[0.00-0.27]What?[0.42-2.79]No, Rose, I haven’t been leaving you any messages.
MM_RE08_020_WAKE_5122=[0.00-1.09]Right.[1.09-1.85]Thank you, Rose.[3.05-3.77]I’ll do what I can.
MM_RE08_020_WAKE_5126=[0.00-0.92]Thank you, Ahti.
MM_RE08_025a_WAKE_12601=[0.07-0.85]The Writer’s Room.[1.34-3.02]The tools I always used.[3.45-5.21]The Plot Board and my typewriter.
MM_RE08_025a_WAKE_12602=[0.03-3.45]Return’s ending was an eternal Deerfest that would keep spreading.[4.05-7.13]Given time, Scratch would plunge the world into his nightmare.[7.89-9.28]I had to stop that from happening.[9.60-11.93]I had to write one more chapter for Return.
MM_RE08_025a_WAKE_12603=[0.03-2.37]A perfect ending that would save us all.[2.92-4.38]I was the only one who could write it.[4.96-6.30]Everything depended on this.[7.24-7.75]On me.
MM_RE08_025a_WAKE_12604=[0.00-2.28]Any second now, Scratch would burst through that door.[2.28-2.89]To stop me.[3.61-5.43]Every plot thread dangled in my brain.[6.35-7.76]It suddenly felt impossible.
MM_RE08_025a_WAKE_12605=[0.03-1.51]Something stirred in the room.[1.93-2.58]Coming to me.[3.35-4.05]An idea.
MM_RE08_025a_WAKE_7368=[0.03-0.67]I was here.[1.08-2.52]I needed to write the ending.[2.95-5.06]I only had one chance to get this right.
MM_RE08_025a_WAKE_7369=[0.00-5.88]I needed an ending that took everything already in Return and extended it into a conclusion that would save us.[6.51-8.00]Only the perfect ending would work.

That’s how we’ll keep people safe. We’ll be a legend. We are the Cult of the Tree and we watch in the night.

PAT_MAINE_RADIO_01_PAT_MAINE_16723=[0.03-3.16]Did they bring all this darn rain with them?[4.07-8.70]Deerfest is right around the corner, and we’re all crossing our fingers for sunshine,[8.80-14.54]so I reached out to our top meteorologist for a weather update.[15.74-21.76]She never responded, but I have her uncle Tapio on the line from Watery.[22.01-24.00]Tapio, are you there?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_01_PAT_MAINE_16725=[0.00-4.13]Great, and Tapio, what kind of weather can we expect today?

PAT_MAINE_RADIO_02_DONNA_16743=[0.00-3.48]No, lunch is at eleven and I wanted to save my appetite-[3.52-6.05]because today was the fish soup with crackers.[6.10-10.85]You’re allowed up to four crackers, but I only take one unless I have a glass of cranberry juice.[11.25-14.34]They ran out of cranberry juice at breakfast, which is at seven.[14.65-18.19]I didn’t take the oatmeal today because it makes me gassy before cribbage-
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_02_DONNA_16745=[0.05-3.81]They had teriyaki salmon with rice on Friday’s dinner menu.[4.27-9.48]Dinner’s at five, but we all know the salmon takes longer to prepare and then you’re late for bingo.[9.72-11.47]And who needs all that spice?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_02_PAT_MAINE_16740=[0.00-3.68]Welcome back and boy do we have some breaking news-[3.55-5.91]that’s sure to knock your socks off.[6.48-14.48]Davis Family Beef Jerky will now be available at the Sunday market in three delicious flavors.[15.05-20.12]That’s right, our favorite sponsor, Davis Family Beef Jerky,[20.20-27.60]can now be enjoyed in smoked hickory, teriyaki, and hickory teriyaki.[27.68-30.99]I handed out samples here at the Valhalla Nursing Home-[31.05-35.33] and thought I’d catch up with one of our residents to get her thoughts.[35.82-37.41]Donna, how are you?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_02_PAT_MAINE_16742=[0.03-0.98]Oh dear.[1.53-5.81]Y’know, when I’m feeling stiff I find a light snack helps.[5.98-8.36]So did you try that beef jerky?

PAT_MAINE_RADIO_02_TAPIO_16752=[0.00-0.71]Wendy?[1.37-3.64]No, that can’t be right.[4.08-6.52]Wendy went missing in 2010.[7.21-8.75]I heard she’s dead.

PAT_MAINE_RADIO_03_PAT_MAINE_16760=[0.15-2.97]Oh the pleasure’s all mine, Terry.[3.98-6.94]Now I hear you’re doing something special for Deerfest.[7.08-8.23]Tell us about that.

PAT_MAINE_RADIO_03_PAT_MAINE_16767=[0.04-0.93]Oh boy.[2.63-5.18]That’s a strange joke you’re playing there, Terry.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_03_PAT_MAINE_16769=[0.05-2.92]Well that’s just not possible, Terry.[3.30-7.35]Wendy stopped by this morning with three flavors of beef jerky.[7.67-13.84]She brought the, the, the smoked hickory, and the teriyaki, and...[13.84-14.84]What’s that other one?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_03_PAT_MAINE_16771=[0.08-1.56]What’s that other one?[1.92-3.87]She was just talking about this.[3.87-4.93]Just hours ago.[4.93-7.50]Smoked hickory, teriyaki and...
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_03_PAT_MAINE_16773=[0.00-1.89]Hickory teriyaki.[2.05-3.34]Thanks, Tapio.[3.79-6.95]It’s just a bit of a strange joke, Terry.[7.66-9.48]Did Jaakko and Ilmo put you up to this?

PAT_MAINE_RADIO_03_TERRY_16761=[0.29-6.06]Yeah, I’m crafting a selection of custom basswood cuckoo clocks,[6.12-12.10]but the real special sauce is when it’s cuckoo time and you’re expecting a bird to pop out for a chirp...[13.05-14.38]Out comes a big ol’ deer.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_03_TERRY_16763=[0.69-1.91]Yeah, it’s pretty neat.

PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_JIM_FIGAMORE_16779=[0.17-3.52]No, this is Jim Figamore.[4.21-6.61]Remember we were gonna do the announcement today?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_JIM_FIGAMORE_16781=[0.15-7.29]And I’m here to announce that the theater will be losing one of its most dignified thespians, as I,[7.40-11.80]Jim Figamore, will be running for mayor.[12.86-14.22]Hold for applause.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_JIM_FIGAMORE_16783=[0.31-3.13]The real question is what happened to this town.[4.00-11.10]Bright Falls used to draw in thousands of tourists with its vibrant arts scene and impressive bird feeders.[12.73-14.66]And what’s our reputation now?[15.48-16.92]“Haunted Bright Falls".[17.21-19.01]“Spooky Bright Falls".[19.49-21.72]The world is laughing at us![23.56-25.90]And now all this business with the FBI?[27.40-34.48]We need a mayor who can turn this town’s reputation around, and nobody knows more about the role of mayor than I do.[35.56-41.41]I played one in the theatrical production of Fiorello, to glowing reviews by Coffee World Magazine.[42.38-45.47]Mayor Setter is a joke, and you know what?[45.57-46.68]I hear he kills cats.[46.71-48.44]There, I said it.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_JIM_FIGAMORE_16786=[0.40-2.95]The only jerk I care about is Mayor Setter.[4.33-11.38]Our future’s at stake, pets are being murdered, and it’s time for a change.[12.04-14.56]Jim Figamore for mayor.[17.02-19.07]That concludes our program today.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_JIM_FIGAMORE_16788=[0.44-3.22]Jim Figamore and Pat Maine signing off.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_JIM_FIGAMORE_16789=[0.44-3.58]And we’ve got a great tune here to play us out.[4.14-5.85]Take it away, Pat.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_PAT_MAINE_16776=[0.00-4.53]And that wraps up my list of favorite park benches in Bright Falls.[5.15-9.71]And now I just want to clear something up from our last broadcast.[10.57-17.33]There was some talk, an off-color joke of sorts, about Wendy Davis of Davis Family Beef Jerky being dead,[17.73-20.54]which of course is a bunch of hogwash.[21.16-28.47]So, I’m gonna give our dear friend Wendy a call so we can put an end to these silly rumors and- oh![28.84-31.15]It looks like we already have her on the line.[32.00-33.47]Wendy, hello.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_PAT_MAINE_16778=[0.00-2.41]And that’s not Wendy.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_PAT_MAINE_16780=[0.03-2.12]Oh, is that- Was that today?[2.86-9.82]Listeners, we have Jim Figamore with us, the director of the Bright Falls Community Theater, and-
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_PAT_MAINE_16782=[0.03-3.50]Well that’s quite an announcement, Jim.[4.30-5.85]Just let me find my notes here.[5.85-8.40]I had some questions written down for you.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_PAT_MAINE_16784=[0.00-2.33]Now, Jim, this is a family show.[3.05-7.22]I found my notes here, so why don’t we pivot to some questions.[7.30-8.16]First question.[8.29-12.08]What exactly goes into that delicious beef jerky?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_PAT_MAINE_16785=[0.06-7.04]Right, so it looks like these are my questions for Wendy Davis of Davis Family Beef Jerky.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_04_PAT_MAINE_16787=[0.03-1.85]Oh, I actually had more to-
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_GIL_DAVIS_16793=[0.64-0.96]Yeah.[1.40-2.54]Gil Davis here.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_GIL_DAVIS_16795=[0.84-2.03]You need to stop.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_GIL_DAVIS_16797=[0.34-1.09]Just stop.[1.80-3.90]Whatever this is you’re doing, stop.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_GIL_DAVIS_16799=[1.00-3.83]There’s no such thing as Davis Family Beef Jerky.[4.53-9.00]I don’t sell beef jerky, I’ve never made beef jerky, and I don’t particularly like beef jerky.[9.48-12.77]I’m getting crazy phone calls for jerky orders, day and night.[13.17-18.59]You’ve got confused old ladies all over this goddamn town on the hunt for imaginary beef jerky,[18.68-23.73]asking for insane flavors like hickory teriyaki, which clearly isn’t a thing.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_GIL_DAVIS_16801=[0.63-1.87]Wendy is dead, Pat!
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_GIL_DAVIS_16803=[0.93-3.65]Wendy went missing in 13 years ago, Pat.[4.75-5.64]They found her body.[6.53-7.42]She’s dead.[8.40-9.83]We’re trying to make peace with that,[9.87-13.59]and you’re making it so much harder with all this goddamn beef jerky bullshit.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_GIL_DAVIS_16805=[1.57-4.20]She’s fucking dead, Pat.[5.11-5.82]Stop.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_PAT_MAINE_16790=[0.00-4.03]You can pick up those crochet dog sweaters at the Sunday Market.[4.43-10.72]And while you’re there, go visit Wendy Davis and grab some of our sponsor’s famous beef jerky.[11.53-17.40]Up next, we’ve got Deerfest- Oh, hold on now, we have a call coming in.[17.55-19.75]Which button’s the...[20.06-20.66]Hello?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_PAT_MAINE_16792=[0.03-1.26]Wrong line.[1.26-2.37]Hold on.[2.40-6.02]Hello, you’re on with Pat Maine.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_PAT_MAINE_16794=[0.00-2.24]What a pleasant surprise![2.72-8.16]We have Gil Davis on the line from our lovely sponsor, Davis Family Beef Jerky.[8.52-12.03]Gil, any thoughts on those crochet dog sweaters?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_PAT_MAINE_16796=[0.68-1.40]What’s that?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_PAT_MAINE_16798=[0.04-2.37]I’m not sure I understand, Gil.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_PAT_MAINE_16800=[0.00-7.10]If you don’t sell beef jerky, then somebody needs to tell your lovely wife, Wendy,[7.15-10.96]because she’s out there at the market every Sunday selling it.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_PAT_MAINE_16802=[1.11-3.95]No, that’s... that's not right.[5.13-9.01]I just saw Wendy at the market last weekend.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_PAT_MAINE_16804=[0.00-0.59]No.[0.87-2.40]That’s just not true.[2.56-3.86]She’s there.[4.17-6.96]Every weekend I see her there.[7.79-13.81]This joke’s gone far enough, now go get Wendy on the line so we can all have a laugh about this.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_PAT_MAINE_16806=[0.03-0.45]Gil?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_PAT_MAINE_16807=[1.37-3.50]I think we’re out of time.[4.44-4.91]Um.[5.72-6.58]Dog sweaters.[6.86-7.68]Sunday market.[8.38-8.67]And...[9.96-10.72]Yeah.[11.10-12.47]Pat Maine signing off.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_PAT_MAINE_16808=[0.00-2.08]I think we should take a break.[2.08-2.75]Um.[3.48-4.61]Dog sweaters.[4.78-5.82]Sunday market.[5.82-6.24]And...[7.29-7.42]um...[7.42-8.76]here’s a song.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_05_TAPIO_16791=[0.22-0.90]Hello.[1.45-2.50]Still here.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_NORMAN_16810=[0.00-1.15]Which light?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_NORMAN_16812=[0.00-2.15]You sure you’re not on the air?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_NORMAN_16814=[0.00-3.33]Have you tried just mashing all these buttons?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_NORMAN_16816=[0.03-1.33]This one right here.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_NORMAN_16817=[0.00-1.12]Nope, that wasn’t it.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_NORMAN_16824=[0.00-3.01]No, that girl drowned in Cauldron Lake.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_NORMAN_16827=[0.00-3.81]What about this button here with the sticky note that says “on off".
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_PAT_MAINE_16809=[0.00-3.48]Yes, I’m pressing the button but it’s not broadcasting.[4.10-6.21]That green light is supposed to be red.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_PAT_MAINE_16811=[0.21-1.08]This one here.[1.38-7.30]Donna’s grandson wrote down instructions for me but I can’t for the life of me remember where I put them.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_PAT_MAINE_16813=[0.00-2.66]Yeah green means off, red means on.[2.66-5.18]Or was it- No, that’s right.[6.13-7.99]I need a red light here.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_PAT_MAINE_16815=[0.03-3.82]Oh, raspberries, that’s not- Which button did you press?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_PAT_MAINE_16818=[0.06-2.07]I’m gonna call Donna’s grandson.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_PAT_MAINE_16820=[0.06-0.88]Tapio?[1.69-2.09]Sorry.[2.09-3.55]I misdialed.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_PAT_MAINE_16822=[0.04-2.94]Can we get Tapio off the line?[2.94-5.11]I need to call Donna’s grandson.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_PAT_MAINE_16826=[0.00-3.53]Can we please focus on making the green light red?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_PAT_MAINE_16828=[0.00-0.84]Yes![0.87-2.27]That’s the one.[2.59-5.22]Okay, let’s press that and see if it-
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_TAPIO_16819=[0.49-1.13]Hello?
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_TAPIO_16821=[0.13-1.68]No, you didn’t.[2.15-3.89]I was still on the line.
PAT_MAINE_RADIO_06_TAPIO_16823=[0.13-3.57]Must be all this rain botching up your connection.[3.97-7.36]If it keeps up that bunker out back could flood again.[7.86-11.62]A girl drowned in that bunker last time it flooded.

POC2_03_WAKE_769=[0.00-1.99]Wake follows clues and messages.[2.33-3.39]He is not in control.[3.84-5.16]He is being taken on a ride.[5.61-6.28]Led to where?[6.58-7.24]To slaughter?[7.75-8.69]To a revelation?[9.38-10.58]Deeper down the spiral.[10.61-11.90]Into the heart of darkness.[11.90-12.89]Where the truth awaits.[13.42-16.92]The terrifying, blindingly bright truth that will sear his brain.
POC2_03_WAKE_770=[0.03-1.58]Wake must follow the clues.[2.43-3.46]Is he stuck in a loop?[3.93-4.66]A tragedy?[5.08-6.16]Suffering from dementia.[6.66-9.52]Forced to face the same horrors again and again.[9.52-11.51]But what’s the alternative?[12.20-16.50]To fade away, forget, and still be forever trapped in the nightmare.[17.46-18.68]Now that’d be a tragedy.
POC2_03_WAKE_771=[0.00-1.57]Suddenly, Wake isn’t forgetting.[1.98-3.39]For the first time in ages.[4.12-4.75]Why now?[5.55-7.04]Because something has changed.[7.67-8.05]What?[8.77-9.59]The manuscript.[9.91-10.60]It must be.[11.18-14.67]The manuscript that is true and can change things has finally been written.[15.27-16.22]Finally been finished.[16.92-17.65]It’s out there.[18.32-19.18]It exists.
POC2_03_WAKE_772=[0.00-1.89]With the manuscript, the game is now on.[2.63-4.62]Having written it, Wake is a character in it.[5.78-6.93]So why doesn’t he remember?[7.80-8.47]By design.[8.96-9.74]It has to be.[10.43-12.07]Everything is written for a reason.[12.81-14.46]Remembering would ruin the story.[14.93-16.72]He must trust the story.[17.14-19.32]He must follow the cues, the plot.[20.13-22.65]He must play the part of Alan Wake in this story.
POC2_03_WAKE_773=[0.03-5.24]The writer is a sculptor, chiseling away the lies to reveal the hidden, true shape of reality.[5.82-10.17]The writer is a detective, piecing together the clues to find the awful crime.[10.85-19.75]The writer is a shrink and a priest, shining a light at the darkest corners of the mind, the soul, to reveal the disorder, the demon inside.
POC2_03_WAKE_774=[0.00-5.68]The writer writes a story that resonates and is true, so true it’s more true than reality.[6.26-11.72]So true it changes reality, even if it is just a construct of fiction and lies.
POC2_03_WAKE_998=[0.00-1.78]I could piece it together in my writer’s room.
POC2_03_WAKE_999=[0.03-2.31]I could always figure things out in the writer’s room.
POC2_04_WAKE_1003=[0.00-2.13]The lamp I carried felt dead in my hand.[3.25-5.04]I needed to find a way to light it up.
POC2_04_WAKE_1005=[0.00-1.25]I had a light in my lamp.[1.88-3.22]I’d find a place to use it.
POC2_04_WAKE_1006=[0.00-2.28]I needed to find a lamp to place the light I had.
POC2_04_WAKE_1007=[0.00-2.59]I had to use the light of my lamp to create a way forward.
POC2_04_WAKE_1008=[0.00-2.02]I could use my lamp to open a path forward.
POC2_04_WAKE_1009=[0.07-2.28]I’d shift the light from my lamp to  change reality.
POC2_04_WAKE_743=[0.03-1.23]I got Alice out of here.[2.16-2.75]Or did I?[3.65-4.66]Was that another lie?[5.49-7.38]This place hides the truth.[8.06-10.31]How could she be here, under attack from Scratch?[11.02-11.92]I had to find out.[12.19-13.90]I had to make sure she was safe.[14.20-16.00]I had to get to the subway station.
POC2_04_WAKE_775=[0.03-2.22]This was where Underwood Station should’ve been.[3.03-3.83]But it was not.[4.62-6.31]I needed to make it reveal itself.
POC2_04_WAKE_785=[0.00-1.52]I felt a current in my arm.[2.16-4.83]A magnetic pull between my lamp and the streetlamp.
POC2_04_WAKE_786=[0.00-2.42]The light shifted from the streetlamp to my lamp.[2.81-3.30]Jumped.[3.60-4.75]Like something in a dream.
POC2_04_WAKE_787=[0.03-2.19]I felt the electric current in the lamp again.[2.89-4.95]I could use it here, with the store window.
POC2_05_ANNOUNCEMENT_794=[0.41-1.76]Your train is now arriving.[2.08-4.00]Please stand away from the platform edge.
POC2_05_FADE-OUT_829=[0.22-1.56]Wake had fallen asleep.
POC2_05_FADE-OUT_830=[0.21-1.43]He ran on autopilot.
POC2_05_FADE-OUT_831=[0.21-0.78]He was numb.
POC2_05_WAKE_1010=[0.03-1.50]I needed to find a way out of here.[2.07-2.87]A way forward.[3.37-5.28]I needed a light to change this place.
POC2_05_WAKE_1011=[0.00-0.99]I didn’t have a light.
POC2_05_WAKE_1012=[0.00-2.36]I had left a light in the lamp store window above.[3.13-4.10]I could get it from there.
POC2_05_WAKE_1013=[0.00-1.02]I needed a light.
POC2_05_WAKE_1014=[0.03-1.32]I needed to find a light.
POC2_05_WAKE_1015=[0.00-1.65]I had to find a light for my lamp.
POC2_05_WAKE_1016=[0.00-1.92]I needed a light to create a way forward.
POC2_05_WAKE_1017=[0.03-1.85]I needed to get a light to pass through.
POC2_05_WAKE_1018=[0.00-1.84]The spring water can was a clue.[2.28-4.29]A revelation swimming just out of reach.[5.11-6.78]I could figure it out in the writer’s room.
POC2_05_WAKE_1019=[0.00-2.73]I had used the plot board to break down countless stories.[3.25-5.75]I could figure out this clue, see how it fit in.
POC2_05_WAKE_788=[0.03-0.89]I never left.[1.63-3.83]Impossibly, it was the same station.[4.47-5.31]Caught in a loop.[6.22-7.05]This was not the way.[7.60-9.35]Something needed to change first.
POC2_05_WAKE_789=[0.00-0.77]No Alice here.[1.64-2.40]Just an echo.[3.80-5.43]With her eyes scratched out.[6.40-7.25]Scratch.
POC2_05_WAKE_790=[0.00-1.15]No way back anymore.[1.81-3.11]I had to find a way forward.
POC2_05_WAKE_792=[0.00-1.55]This is where I’ll find the next clue.
POC2_05_WAKE_793=[0.00-1.84]Cauldron Lake Spring Water.[2.71-3.70]It felt important.[4.45-6.37]Like something from a half-forgotten dream.[6.37-8.35]Or from a previous life.[9.39-10.55]It was a way forward.
POC2_05_WAKE_795=[0.00-0.39]Damn.
POC2_05_WAKE_796=[0.00-3.02]There was something here with me, hunting me.[3.02-4.79]A Dark Presence.[5.27-6.27]Something alien.[7.07-7.80]A monster.[8.55-9.72]It had stolen from me.[9.72-11.92]And what it had taken, it was twisting.[12.64-13.46]It wanted more.[14.11-14.82]Everything.[15.45-16.70]It already wore my face.[17.61-18.45]Scratch.[19.32-20.41]Mr. Scratch.
POC2_05_WAKE_855=[0.44-1.70]Wake had fallen asleep.[1.96-3.36]A spiral into oblivion.[3.61-6.00]Until, lucky or cursed: A spark of light.[6.26-7.42]An act of creation.[7.67-8.86]An act of violence.[9.14-9.98]Waking him up.[10.20-10.91]To the horror.
POC2_05_WAKE_996=[0.00-2.14]Everything was heavy with meaning in this place.[2.66-4.10]Nothing was here by chance.[4.37-5.74]Nothing was unrelated.[6.42-7.72]I had to trust these signs.[8.01-10.08]Follow them, no matter where they took me.
POC2_06_WAKE_745=[0.00-1.43]My thoughts were bleeding out.[1.90-4.09]The darkest thoughts from the deepest trenches.[4.26-5.72]Shaping this place around me.[6.02-6.62]New York.[7.15-8.86]My home, twisted.[9.29-10.62]A nightmare of New York.
POC2_06_WAKE_797=[0.03-1.48]I was back where I started.[1.96-3.03]Was this another loop?[4.02-6.00]No, things felt different.[6.68-9.15]The map of the city changing in dream-like ways.[9.75-11.82]Not a loop; a spiral.[12.55-13.88]I was making progress.
POC2_07_WAKE_1020=[0.00-1.37]The payphone was ringing again.
POC2_07_WAKE_1021=[0.00-1.35]A matchbook from a nightclub.
POC2_07_WAKE_1022=[0.00-1.97]I had left a light at the subway station.[2.63-3.58]I could get it from there.
POC2_07_WAKE_746=[0.00-2.10]It felt like being lost in a dream.[2.78-4.57]Lost in a watery reflection.[5.42-7.60]A free association spiral.[8.17-9.74]Crazy and shifting.[10.70-14.09]From a musical to a horror story and everything in between.[15.24-17.25]A feeling of deja vu that didn’t go away.[17.85-19.71]An endless, recursive loop.[20.45-22.12]An echo of an echo.[22.95-26.91]I was lost in the depths of a dark ocean, at the mercy of the currents.
POC2_07_WAKE_798=[0.00-0.41]Hello?
POC2_07_WAKE_799=[0.00-0.58]Be that way.
POC2_07_WAKE_800=[0.00-1.59]Was I left hanging without a clue?[2.30-2.68]No.
POC2_07_WAKE_801=[0.00-1.11]Mirror Peak Nightclub.[1.86-3.21]An echo of something.[4.36-5.38]That’s where I was going.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1030=[0.00-1.33]Money is a powerful symbol.[1.69-3.71]But the bill was just a utensil for the drug.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1031=[0.03-1.90]I recognized the symbol on the bag.[2.59-3.73]Scratch’s cult.[4.35-5.74]To melt their minds with his.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1032=[0.03-3.08]I was certain that all the symbols had a meaning and a purpose here.[4.00-5.38]But which would be the way forward?
POC2_08b_WAKE_1033=[0.00-1.98]Things were not clicking into place.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1034=[0.06-1.25]The plot eluded me.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1035=[0.00-0.92]It didn’t feel right.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1036=[0.00-1.18]It felt like a dead end.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1037=[0.00-1.07]I was missing something.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1038=[0.00-0.55]That’s it.[1.17-2.51]This was how it was meant to go.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1039=[0.00-1.28]This felt right for the story.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1040=[0.03-1.08]I had figured it out.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1041=[0.00-1.35]Things clicked into place.
POC2_08b_WAKE_1042=[0.00-1.21]I had found the solution.
POC2_08c_WAKE_1043=[0.00-0.79]Time to go.[1.25-2.02]Through the mirror.
POC2_08_WAKE_1023=[0.00-2.42]I felt a surge of claustrophobic panic.[3.08-4.20]These stairs would never end.[4.20-7.41]And the walls were definitely edging closer the deeper I went.[9.01-13.85]I saw a vision of myself, getting stuck between them, having traveled down an impossible distance.
POC2_08_WAKE_1024=[0.00-1.90]The painting marked my destination.[2.58-4.15]It might have looked like my portrait.[4.69-5.37]But it wasn’t.[5.84-6.75]It was Scratch.
POC2_08_WAKE_1025=“Meet me in the bathroom. Your number one fan.”
POC2_08_WAKE_1026=[0.00-2.12]Hidden messages from Scratch’s number one fan.
POC2_08_WAKE_1027=[0.00-2.28]The bag of drugs fit the scene perfectly.[3.53-5.79]I’d had my share of crazy nights in the past.[6.83-8.66]This whole place felt like I was tripping.
POC2_08_WAKE_1028=[0.00-1.28]The bill went with the drugs.
POC2_08_WAKE_1029=[0.00-6.38]To understand it, to change the plot and the world around me, I had to put the symbols in their place  in the writer’s room.
POC2_08_WAKE_747=[0.00-2.18]This place used anything I could imagine.[2.67-6.04]And I could imagine some pretty fucked up things, professionally speaking.[7.00-9.63]I wished it’d stop there, but it didn’t.[10.24-18.34]Under this oily film, under the surface, hidden, there were other things, worse things, unimaginable things.[18.97-20.68]I was not in control here.
POC2_08_WAKE_802=[0.03-0.75]Another loop.
POC2_08_WAKE_803=[0.00-7.27]Once, a long time ago, with my celebrity lifestyle spiraling out of control I’d spend my nights in places like this.[8.32-9.37]This had been my scene.[10.18-11.48]Now it was Scratch’s.
POC2_08_WAKE_804=[0.00-3.64]The more progress I made here, the more I attracted the Dark Presence to me.[4.33-5.19]It was hunting me.[5.81-6.91]It was getting closer.[8.14-11.60]The clues Scratch left, when I found them, were like trackers to draw it to me.[12.69-13.75]He wanted to stop me.[14.72-15.88]I had to keep going.
POC2_08_WAKE_805=[0.00-2.41]The VIP section was Scratch’s domain.
POC2_08_WAKE_806=[0.00-0.80]This was a clue.[1.54-2.44]The bathroom.[3.29-4.55]Ladies’ room by the looks of it.
POC2_08_WAKE_856=[0.44-1.84]Wake had the compulsion to write.[2.26-3.13]Like a sickness.[3.37-5.20]Dig inside the heads of every reader.[5.54-6.76]To control their minds.[7.06-8.70]Reaching into the darkness inside.
POC2_09_WAKE_748=[0.00-2.24]This was not my first attempt to get out.[2.73-4.67]But this place made me forget.[5.36-6.68]And then forget forgetting.[7.59-10.57]What I had pieced together I’d left as clues for myself.[10.94-13.07]Shortcuts to take me forward faster.[13.49-14.03]Cheats.[14.37-15.51]Symbols with meaning.
POC2_09_WAKE_857=[0.00-2.02]I was back in a familiar place again.[2.58-3.70]One layer deeper.[4.29-5.58]Closer to where I was going.
POC2_10_WAKE_858=[0.00-1.31]It was always the phone.
POC2_10_WAKE_859=[0.00-1.30]It wasn't the payphone this time.[2.18-4.75]The ringing telephone was somewhere in the building next to me.
POC2_11_WAKE_1044=[0.00-1.21]The street had changed.[1.70-4.61]The “Lady of the Light” sign on both sides, mirrored.
POC2_11_WAKE_1045=[0.00-2.11]The apartment on the third floor had the lights on.
POC2_11_WAKE_1046=[0.00-0.31]Hey![0.98-1.51]You there!
POC2_11_WAKE_1047=[0.00-0.80]That was him.[1.17-1.98]Scratch.[2.43-3.35]I was close.
POC2_11_WAKE_860=[0.00-1.88]The ringing came from an upstairs apartment.
POC2_12_WAKE_764=[0.00-5.55]Last time Scratch’s sick game, his clues, led me to a line of a poem.[6.26-7.41]That poem has power.[7.83-8.74]A hidden truth.[9.05-10.85]I had to find more lines.
POC2_13_OLD_LADY_861=[0.44-2.79]You’re such a nice young man, Mr. Wake.
POC2_13_OLD_LADY_862=[0.44-1.45]Oh oh, Alan.[1.88-2.66]Yes, Alan.
POC2_13_OLD_LADY_863=[0.44-2.46]To think that I have a famous writer as a neighbor.
POC2_13_OLD_LADY_864=[0.44-2.16]And such wonderfully written stories.[2.36-3.21]So exciting.
POC2_13_OLD_LADY_865=[0.57-3.36]The mysteries and all the chases, and, and the gun fights![3.57-5.17]Gets your blood pumping, it does.
POC2_13_OLD_LADY_866=[0.43-1.78]More tea, Mr. Wake, Alan?
POC2_13_OLD_LADY_867=[0.34-2.02]To think I have a celebrity in my home.[2.34-3.89]So nice of you to come say hello.
POC2_13_OLD_LADY_868=[0.45-1.32]You shouldn’t have.[1.50-2.80]Thank you so much for the book.[2.93-4.15]I will treasure it always.
POC2_13_OLD_LADY_869=[0.45-1.34]Come back soon.[1.34-2.01]Anytime.[2.49-4.73]It does get lonely here sometimes, on my own.
POC2_13_WAKE_1048=[0.03-2.60]There were more lamps here than in the store down the street.
POC2_13_WAKE_1049=[0.00-3.55]Everything was mirrored here, from the sign outside to my book.
POC2_13_WAKE_870=[0.03-0.88]It wasn’t me.[1.23-3.23]It was Scratch, pretending to be me.[3.76-4.81]It was disgusting.
POC2_14_OLD_LADY_872=[0.44-0.86]Hello?[0.90-1.44]Who's there?
POC2_14_OLD_LADY_873=[0.44-1.35]Is there someone there?[1.89-2.36]Go away!
POC2_14_OLD_LADY_874=[0.44-1.06]Please![1.33-2.48]I have no money.
POC2_14_OLD_LADY_875=[0.45-1.53]I’m calling the police!
POC2_14_OLD_LADY_876=[0.41-1.53]Why are you doing this?
POC2_14_OLD_LADY_877=[0.43-0.74]Help![0.74-1.55]Somebody help!
POC2_14_OLD_LADY_878=[0.45-1.72]I thought you were a nice man.
POC2_14_OLD_LADY_879=Aaaahhhh!
POC2_14_WAKE_808=[0.03-0.51]Stop!
POC2_14_WAKE_871=[0.00-1.87]It felt like my brain was dislocated.[2.31-3.09]Another loop.[3.71-6.45]This was the same apartment, but the right way around.
POC2_15_WAKE_1050=[0.03-1.37]The ringing was louder now.[1.79-2.68]One floor up.
POC2_16_WAKE_891=[0.00-2.42]The sounds were now coming from down the corridor.
POC2_16_WAKE_892=[0.03-0.51]Damn.
POC2_17_SCRATCH_1051=[0.44-2.86]Lost on the shore between the forest and the ocean.[3.31-5.16]The owl and the deer reflected in motion.
POC2_17_WAKE_1052=[0.03-2.83]I had to add the new line to the poem, in the writer’s room.
POC2_17_WAKE_1053=[0.05-2.77]Lost on the shore between the forest and the ocean.[3.51-6.11]The owl and the deer reflected in motion.
POC2_17_WAKE_893=[0.00-0.39]Aaah...[0.69-1.84]oh my god.
POC2_17_WAKE_894=[0.04-2.51]Scratch had left me a new line of the poem.[3.16-4.25]I didn’t understand it.[4.36-5.24]I didn’t like it.[5.24-6.58]But it was hugely important.[7.41-9.61]It was a key to travel through the Dark Place.
POC2_18_WAKE_895=[0.08-1.00]I’d write down the poem.[1.62-3.15]It would take me to where I needed to be.
POC2_19_WAKE_1054=[0.59-2.66]The writer wants the story to be true.[7.45-9.00]It’s easy to start believing in it.[9.31-10.22]Especially here.[13.76-15.55]The map versus the territory.[16.65-18.27]The poem was a map.[18.33-24.48]It was taking me somewhere.[25.60-26.43]Somewhere dark.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_931=[0.04-2.42]The bad parts in him.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_932=[0.12-3.21]Reaching into the darkness inside.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_933=[0.34-2.06]Sinking into a dream.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_934=[0.00-2.48]To control their minds.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_935=[0.16-2.44]To force them to love him.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_936=[0.05-3.41]Dig inside the heads of every reader.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_937=[0.05-3.46]Meaningless in the face of his creation.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_938=[0.14-2.21]Like a sickness.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_939=“Who am I?” 
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_940=“Where am I?”
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_941=[0.15-3.33]Nothing felt like anything anymore.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_942=[0.09-3.18]A spiral into oblivion.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_943=[0.00-1.61]He was numb.
POC2_Barks_FO_raisedvoice_FADE-OUT_944=[0.26-2.95]Wake had fallen asleep.

POI_TIM_02_TIM_14639=[0.10-0.96]Good to hear, man.
POI_TIM_02_TIM_14641=[0.15-0.74]Not great.[2.00-7.20]This dream we’re in is putting a lot of roadblocks in my way.
POI_TIM_02_TIM_14643=[0.07-1.06]I’m not ruling it out.[3.20-6.69]My dreams have always been incredibly vivid.[9.77-12.56]They feel real until the second I wake up.
POI_TIM_02_TIM_14644=[0.00-4.57]In the dreams, I’m often someone else.[4.57-9.80]A different person with a different name living a different life in a different world.[12.59-14.29]Alternate realities, maybe.[17.71-18.86]But certain things don’t change.[21.47-22.20]Like Door.

POI_TIM_02_WAKE_14638=[0.10-0.77]I know, Tim.[0.77-1.88]I’m remembering more now.
POI_TIM_02_WAKE_14640=[0.04-1.67]How is your search for Mr. Door going?
POI_TIM_02_WAKE_14642=[0.03-1.33]So you think this is a dream?
POI_TIM_02_WAKE_14645=[0.04-2.43]The sketch you have does look like the Door I know.[3.05-3.97]The talk show host.

POI_TIM_03_TIM_14650=[0.00-0.58]Ha ha.[1.38-2.21]You had me going.
POI_TIM_03_TIM_14651=[0.00-3.99]You know, your disappearance from Bright Falls is still the only thing folks talk about.[4.51-6.47]Well, that and Deerfest.[9.00-11.24]Is this where you ended up back in 2010?
POI_TIM_03_TIM_14653=[0.05-1.53]I am the sheriff of Bright Falls.[2.29-5.49]Or I was.
POI_TIM_03_TIM_14655=[0.01-1.74]Yeah, she's my cousin.[2.99-5.77]I had a police sketch made of Door based on my dreams.[5.92-9.31]I sent it around and Sarah recognized the face from an old case file from the eighties.[10.04-13.98]I moved out there to look into it and became sheriff after she left to join the Feds.
POI_TIM_03_TIM_14657=[0.00-1.19]Not a lot of details in it.[2.11-4.79]A local man named Warlin Door went missing near Cauldron Lake.[5.48-9.03]Eyewitnesses claim he was struck by a bolt of lightning and just vanished.[11.33-14.70]I never found any official records of a Warlin Door living in town, or anywhere.[16.21-16.94]Another dead end.
POI_TIM_03_TIM_14659=[0.03-0.50]Oh yeah.[1.01-1.97]It's bigger than ever.[1.97-5.95]I got zapped here right before it was about to happen.

POI_TIM_03_WAKE_14652=[0.00-1.06]You know about that?
POI_TIM_03_WAKE_14654=[0.05-1.50]Are you related to Sarah Breaker?[2.26-4.92]She was the sheriff of Bright Falls back in 2010.
POI_TIM_03_WAKE_14656=[0.00-1.75]What was in the case file about Door?
POI_TIM_03_WAKE_14658=[0.03-1.81]So Deerfest is still a thing?
POI_TIM_03_WAKE_14660=[0.16-0.89]Funny.[1.00-1.57]Me too.

POI_TIM_04_TIM_14662=[0.00-0.36]Yup.[1.74-4.68]I’ve never been to New York, but I can tell you this ain’t it.
POI_TIM_04_TIM_14664=[0.00-3.04]Yeah, I can’t get this song out of my head.[3.04-4.17]A real earworm.[6.16-7.15]I hear it in my dreams.
POI_TIM_04_TIM_14666=[0.00-1.13]That old sci-fi show?
POI_TIM_04_TIM_14668=[0.00-2.74]It sounds a bit nuts, but I think the song’s connected to Door.[4.65-9.03]Or it’s my subconscious telling me this is all pretty out there.
POI_TIM_04_TIM_14670=[0.00-0.46]Yeah.[2.38-3.60]I keep seeing the same people.[3.89-4.57]Door.[4.57-5.68]Other versions of myself.[5.68-6.77]A red-headed woman.[6.87-7.83]I don’t know her name.[10.90-12.73]She keeps telling me she’ll come for me.[15.70-17.13]Don’t know if it’s a promise or a threat.
POI_TIM_04_WAKE_14661=[0.04-0.53]Hey, Tim.[1.10-1.84]New map, huh?
POI_TIM_04_WAKE_14663=[0.12-1.21]I heard you humming again.
POI_TIM_04_WAKE_14665=[0.04-2.06]I know that song you keep humming.[2.94-4.69]It’s the theme from Night Springs.
POI_TIM_04_WAKE_14667=[0.07-2.03]Sci-fi horror anthology.[2.72-4.32]I used to write for it, a long time ago.
POI_TIM_04_WAKE_14669=[0.07-1.81]Still having a vivid dream life?
POI_TIM_05_TIM_14671=[0.00-0.73]Hey, Alan.[1.78-3.13]Good to see another sane face.
POI_TIM_05_TIM_14674=[0.03-1.29]Sounds like you’re having a rough go.[2.15-2.63]I’ve been there.[3.48-4.47]The missing time.[5.10-5.77]The aliens.
POI_TIM_05_TIM_14676=[0.00-1.39]It’s the same thing I’ve been saying.[1.87-2.60]The dreams.[2.77-5.99]Sometimes I wake up in a completely different place, missing entire days.[6.92-9.93]I have no idea what happened, but I’m trying to find out.[10.81-14.67]Things always get better if you just keep moving forward, Alan.
POI_TIM_05_TIM_14678=[0.03-4.53]Oh, I was just convinced that everything going on with me was because of aliens.[4.68-7.71]Abductions, signals beamed into my head, that kind of thing.[8.80-11.02]Now I know it’s been Door all along.[13.35-14.93]I haven’t ruled out him being an alien though.
POI_TIM_05_WAKE_14672=[0.00-1.65]Not sure how sane I’m feeling.
POI_TIM_05_WAKE_14673=[0.04-1.06]Be careful out there, Tim.[2.14-4.48]If you see me, make sure it’s really me.[5.02-6.63]Not some psycho wearing my face.
POI_TIM_05_WAKE_14675=[0.04-0.98]“Missing time”?
POI_TIM_05_WAKE_14677=[0.03-2.73]Wait, what's this about aliens?
POI_TIM_06_TIM_17239=[0.04-0.85]Hey.[2.04-4.08]You’re Alan this time, right?[5.48-6.10]Just making sure.
POI_TIM_06_TIM_17242=[0.04-1.82]Hard to say, but he sure looked like you.[3.27-5.76]It was weird because I heard you got out of this place.[5.76-10.01]Seeing you here, I guess that was just a rumor.[11.22-14.85]Anyway, I’m just doing my thing, still looking for Door.[15.82-17.55]I’ve got a new theory on that front.

RE_05_74_SAGA_1520=[0.45-1.05]He’s right.[1.11-1.93]Time to get to work.
RE_05_74_TOR_1472=[0.44-1.03]Much better.[1.44-3.39]I always knew you were a real Anderson.
RE_05_74_TOR_1474=[0.44-1.68]We all have our own power![2.09-3.53]You, you’re a seer![3.85-7.11]You can find the truth, speak it, create it![7.36-9.75]Use that to fight this bullshit horror story!
RE_05_74_TOR_1476=[0.43-1.10]Fuck no![1.45-2.65]Your daughter’s alive![3.07-5.43]Just not here, not in this nightmare.[5.74-6.92]You gotta trust your gut![7.19-7.95]Your power![8.23-9.89]It runs in the Anderson blood!
RE_05_74_TOR_1479=[0.44-3.05]Yeah, and Odin lost his eye playing darts!
RE_05_74_TOR_1480=[0.46-2.38]So, what do you want to talk about?
RE_05_74_TOR_1482=[0.44-2.77]Honey, I wasn’t the world’s best father.[3.17-5.89]I gave your mom plenty of reasons to keep you in the dark.

RE_05_74_TOR_1484=[0.44-3.79]Freya always hated her power, hated being different.[4.14-5.68]She could do some wild stuff.[6.00-7.62]Nothing like you, though.[7.94-9.78]Must be some of your dad in there.
RE_05_74_TOR_1486=[0.46-1.57]Yeah, I knew him.[1.87-3.30]Freya could have done way better.[3.68-6.30]Him leaving was the best thing that could’ve happened to her.[6.82-8.52]Too bad she didn’t see it that way.
RE_05_74_TOR_1489=[0.43-0.84]Well...[1.11-2.74]I might have had something to do with it.[3.12-3.94]Long story.[4.19-5.92]I don’t wanna get into it right now.

RE_05_74_TOR_1497=[0.42-2.65]The Cult has a hard-on for the Darkness.[3.08-7.18]They’re dangerous, to themselves and everyone else in town.[7.51-8.36]Not my scene.

RE_05_74_TOR_1503=[0.43-1.20]I hope so![1.30-2.99]Or else we’re in deeper shit than you know.
RE_05_74_TOR_1505=[0.44-1.05]Beats me.[1.21-4.51]But if you’re looking for the spook, why don’t you ask him yourself?
RE_05_74_TOR_1513=[0.45-2.57]Still think this is just in your head?[2.94-4.19]You can do so much more.[4.59-6.10]You just don’t know how yet.
RE_05_74_TOR_1515=[0.45-1.87]Rock n’ roll, honey![2.00-2.81]Rock and roll!
RE_05_74_TOR_1517=[0.45-0.97]We’re fine.[1.21-4.85]I was missing a few screws before, but they’re all back where they should be.[5.24-9.96]If you need help, the Old Gods of Asgard are here for you, girl, ready for action![10.21-10.62]And...[10.93-13.07]thanks for helping out an old bastard like me.
RE_05_74_TOR_1519=[0.45-3.37]Go teach those bastards they can’t fuck with the Andersons!
RE_05_74_TOR_1521=[0.46-1.90]I’m fine here, darling.[2.37-4.42]I’ll drag my sorry ass over to my bro.[4.80-7.69]A few shots of Anderson’s finest will fix us both up.[7.96-8.71]Now get going.
